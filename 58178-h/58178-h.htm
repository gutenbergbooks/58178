<h2>The Foulbrood Question.</h2>

<p>The following remarks, made by the Rev. Mr.
Kleine, before a convention of bee-keepers in the
town of Meppen, province of Hanover, Prussia,
present a succinct account of the present state
of this subject abroad.</p>

<p>“The question propounded in our programme,”
said Mr. Kleine, “and which I have been requested
to consider, may properly be thus subdivided&mdash;first.
Has any efficient remedy for foulbrood
been devised? and, secondly, What are
we to think of Lambrecht’s theory?</p>

<p>“I wish I could answer the first interrogatory
with a positive <i>aye</i>. If I could, I should regard
myself entitled not only to your thanks, but to
those of the entire bee-keeping community; for
foulbrood is confessedly the direst evil that can
befall the bee-keeper, and the appearance is, at
present, that it is likely speedily to spread everywhere,
where bees are cultivated.</p>

<p>“Remedies in abundance have, indeed been
suggested, and recommended as efficient and infallible.
But when we come to investigate them,
we seek in vain for any solid reason why curative
qualities should be attributed to them; and
we usually find that the alleged recovery of diseased
colonies can fairly be ascribed to something
else than the application of those vaunted
remedies. Possibly, too, the real disease,&mdash;the
genuine, virulent, contagious foulbrood, did not
exist, and the boasted cure consisted merely in
the apparent arrest and removal of some simple
malady which, in the course of nature, would
speedily have run its harmless course and disappeared,
and with the cure of which the medicaments
or treatment employed had, in reality, no
connection whatever. How indeed can it be
possible to devise and apply an efficient remedy
for a disease of the origin and nature of which
entire ignorance has still prevailed.</p>

<p>“Dr. Asmusz conceived, some years ago, that
he had discovered the cause of foulbrood in a
minute winged insect&mdash;the <i>Phora incrassata</i>;
and the Baron of Berlepsch coincided with him
in opinion. The doctor supposed that the parent
fly deposited her eggs in the larvæ of the bees,
which, dying in consequence and putrifying,
thus generated the devastating disease. It happens,
however, that the Phoridæ do not deposit
their eggs in living organisms, but, under the
impulse of native instinct, in dead bodies only.
Consequently it does not and cannot cause the
dreaded disease.</p>

<p>“Again, Mr. De Molitor assigns to it a similar
origin,&mdash;but instead of the Phora, regards some
ichneumon-fly as the perpetrator of the evil&mdash;unless,
indeed, he regards the Phora itself as an
ichneumon. But this notion, too, is obviously
untenable, for if ichneumon-flies laid their eggs
in the larvæ, those eggs must surely hatch and
the insect develop there, at least in its first stages;
but on placing a foulbroody comb under glass,
and watching it closely, nothing of this sort is
found to take place.</p>

<p>“The Baroness of Berlepsch supposes the
cause of foulbrood is to be found in the use of
movable comb hives, and the various manipulations&mdash;oftimes
needless&mdash;which the facilities afforded
tempt the apiarian to undertake. Were
this diagnosis correct, the remedy could readily
be found. It would only be necessary to discontinue
the use of such hives, and return to the
ancient fixed comb system, to be safe from the
inroads of this pestilence. But alas, it is only
too well known that foulbrood existed extensively
long before Dzierzon was born, and that
it prevails where the fixed comb system is most
rigidly adhered to.</p>

<p>“Others imagine that the disease has its origin
in malarious vapors, in some kind of fungus, in
a diseased condition of the sexual organs of the
queen, in an imperfect fecundation of the egg,
or even in a noxious state of the fluids of the
bee-keeper’s body, &amp;c., without, however, by
any of these surmises or suggestions, furnishing
us with an available clue to a remedy, from the
application of which a favorable result might be
expected. Obscurity and doubt still involve the
inquirer, and he quietly ‘gives it up;’ while the
more practical bee-keeper, perplexed and baffled,
finally resolves to resort to the radical remedy
of the brimstone pit and the ‘parlor match’&mdash;thus
effectually <i>curing</i> his colonies.</p>

<p>“So matters stood in regard to this puzzling
question, till, in consequence of a communication
from the Directors of the Central Committee
of the Hanover Agricultural Society, respecting
an alleged cure of foulbrood which Mr.
Fisher claimed to have devised and successfully
employed, the Hanover Centralblatt opened its
columns for further discussion of the topic.</p>

<p class="caption">
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1870, by Samuel Wagner, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at
Washington.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>“I had given it as my own opinion that the
disease was probably, in most cases, produced by
feeding infected honey derived from foulbroody
colonies; but that we were still constrained to
believe that it had also an independent origin,
which would probably be found in some deleterious
substance mixed with the nutriment of the
bees.</p>

<p>“A reason for this assumption I found in a
communication from Mr. Hoffman to the Eichstadt
Bienenzeitung, in which he stated that in
all foulbroody colonies examined by him, he found
most of the pollen in the cells covered by a slimy,
fatty substance and the pollen itself in a state of
fermentation. I then said that if this discovery
be confirmed by further observation and scientific
investigation, deteriorated pollen would probably
be found to play an important part in the
production of the disease in question, and perhaps
account for the well known fact that in
colonies infected with foulbrood, the larvæ die
only after being sealed up. I also expressed the
hope that we should have the aid of science&mdash;especially
of physiology and chemistry&mdash;in the
further prosecution of the inquiry; as it is only
by ascertaining the nature and origin of the disease,
that we could hope to obtain the means of
effectually counteracting and controlling it.</p>

<p>“We had to wait long for these elucidations,
but they have come at last, and we may well be
proud that the Hanover Centralblatt contributed
so materially to the result so far.</p>

<p>“I now come to the second subdivision of the
question&mdash;What is to be thought of Lambrecht’s
theory?</p>

<p>“This theory is briefly thus: Pollen, in peculiar
circumstances, and under the influence of
heat and moisture, begins to ferment; and the
fermentive process is then communicated to the
honey. If this fermenting nutriment be now
fed to the larvæ, their organism becomes thereby
deranged and disorganized, they die and putrefaction
follows. Here we find the original source
and cause of foulbrood. The detailed explanation
of this so simple theory, given with the directness
of scientific demonstration, yet in popular
language readily understood, is contained in the
pages of the Centralblatt. Its correctness is not
to be doubted, for the proof of it is clearly furnished
by this simple experiment: Expose a
mixture of pollen and water to the heat of the
sun, or otherwise to a temperature sufficiently
high to bring on fermentation, and feed therewith
the bees of a colony containing larvæ just
hatched, and foulbrood will speedily be produced
in the hive. I made this experiment myself in
the summer of 1868, and though I felt some misgivings
before, every doubt was dissipated by
the result obtained, for the thus infected colony
might have claimed a premium as a prime prize
case of the disease. I here submit to the convention,
for inspection, a piece of foulbroody
comb thus obtained. The contagiousness of the
artificially originated foulbrood is also demonstrated
by the fact, that the disease has been
communicated from it to several other colonies
in my apiary. Other bee-keepers have repeated
this experiment with like results; so that there
is no longer room to doubt, or to suspect deception.</p>

<p>“The fermented or fermenting condition of
the nutritive matter with which the larvæ of
bees are fed, is thus, according to Lambrecht’s
theory, the cause of foulbrood. I doubt much
whether this scientifically grounded doctrine will
ever be scientifically refuted.</p>

<p>“We have here, accordingly, the point at
which the insidious foe is to be attacked, if we
would hope for success. This, Lambrecht alleges
that he does, and claims that he has devised a
reliable method of cure, as shown in the experimental
case at Brunswick. To doubt the truth
of the statement made by the committee superintending
that experiment, would be to impugn
the untarnished honor of those gentlemen. But
unfortunately, we are not yet made acquainted
with the composition of Lambrecht’s remedy.
For the present, he treats it as a secret, intending
to publish it in a pamphlet and thus compensate
himself for his discovery. For this, he
has been subjected to reproach and abuse. Allow
me to express my surprise at this. We find
fault with Lambrecht for that which we approve
in ourselves and others. The inventor strives to
secure to himself the profits of his invention by
taking out a patent; and the author indemnifies
himself for his labors by procuring a copyright,
or accepting a premium from his publisher. I
have not hesitated to accept such compensation
myself, when the opportunity was properly presented;
and others, here, I presume, may find
themselves under like condemnation. Why then
cast stones on Lambrecht, who, probably, has
very valid reasons for imitating our example, for
his experiments presuppose a large sacrifice of
time and money on his part.</p>

<p>“I will not deny that, for one, I should have
preferred if Mr. Lambrecht had disinterestedly
published his curative process in a communication
to the Centralblatt. For if No. 7 of the
volume for 1868 is now out of print, in consequence
of the increased demand created for it by
his first article on the subject, there is no doubt
a very large edition would have been required of
the number containing his cure; and what a
powerful impetus that would have given to the
success of the Centralblatt! But I should have
been ashamed to approach Mr. Lambrecht with
a request based on calculations so selfish, when
I understood that he intended to reserve the information
for his own benefit. But there is thus
within our reach a secret of great importance
and value to all bee-keepers; and since we have
no prospect of obtaining a knowledge of it in
any other way than by the publication of his
pamphlet, I advise you all to subscribe for it
and induce others to do so likewise, so that the
work may speedily be published, and the veil
withdrawn that possibly conceals a matter of
vital importance to bee-culture.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lambrecht was requested by the President
of the Nuremberg Convention to attend
its meeting, and present his theory among the
regular orders of the day, for discussion. I felt
confident he would comply with the request, and
considered that the most suitable mode of bringing
his theory to the knowledge of the bee-keepers
generally and securing the required
number of subscribers to his pamphlet. But,
according to the report of the proceedings, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
result was just the reverse. Mr Lambrecht, we
are told, <i>failed altogether</i>! And how? He was
refused a hearing! How this is to be explained,
I know not. Heretofore, the Convention was
ever disposed to invite and allow free discussion
of all questions pertaining to bee-culture, whether
of a theoretical or practical cast; and to accept,
with enthusiastic applause every new invention
or device tending to advance the favorite pursuit
of its members. But this I know for certain,
that Mr. Lambrecht’s theory, despite of this opposition,
will work its way, and finally meet
with universal acceptance. I therefore beg this
respected assembly not to withhold due attention
to this important matter, but to contribute
all they can towards a full compliance with the
stipulations on which the speedy promulgation
of Mr. Lambrecht’s curative process depends.”</p>

<h2>Polanisia Purpurea.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;I would like to give the readers
of the journal my experience with the Rocky
Mountain bee plant <i>Polanisia purpurea</i>. In
1868, I had the pleasure of receiving some of the
seed from Mr. J. L. Hubbard, then of Walpole,
N. H.; and from sixteen plants that grew, I got
six quarts of seed. It comes into bloom about
the last of July, and continues till frost comes.
The bees work on it from morning till night.</p>

<p>In selecting honey-producing plants, it should
be the aim of the bee-keeper to plant such as
would be of benefit to stock or poultry as well as
bees. Now I find that my poultry will eat the
seed of the Polanisia in a short time as readily
as buckwheat; and there is no plant on my farm
that stands the drouth equal to it. At present
(July 25th) we are having a very severe drouth
and extreme heat, yet with the temperature
ranging from 90° to 108° in the shade, not a leaf
of the Polanisia wilts; on the contrary, it is
making a very rapid growth. Taking everything
into consideration, I think it is worthy the
attention of bee-keepers.</p>

<h2>Bees in Borneo and Timor.</h2>

<p>Having recently perused Mr. Spencer St.
John’s very interesting work on Borneo, published
in 1862, under the title of “Life in the
Forests of the Far East,” I have made notes of
several passages relating to the apian aborigines
of that magnificent tropical island:&mdash;</p>

<p>Speaking of the agricultural pursuits of the
“Sea Dayaks,” Mr. St. John says&mdash;“They obtain
beeswax from the nests built on the tapang
tree, and climb the loftiest heights in search of
it, upon small sticks which they drive in as they
advance up the noble stem that rises above one
hundred feet free of branches, and whose girth
varies from fifteen to twenty-five feet. Once
these pegs are driven in, their outer ends are
connected by a stout rattan, which, with the
tree, forms a kind of ladder. It requires cool
and deliberate courage to take a bee-hive at so
great an elevation, where, in case of being
attacked by the bees, the almost naked man
would fall and be dashed to atoms. They depend
upon the flambeaux they carry up with
them, as, when the man disturbs the hive, the
sparks falling from it cause, it is said, the bees
to fly down in chase of them instead of attacking
their real enemy, who then takes the hive
and lowers it down by a rattan string. The
bees escape unhurt. This plan does not appear
to be as safe as that pursued by the Pakatan
Dayaks, who kindle a large fire under the trees,
and, throwing green branches upon it, raise so
stilling a smoke that the bees rush forth, and
the man ascending takes their nest in safety.
Both these operations are generally conducted at
night, although the second might be, I imagine,
practised in safety during the day.”</p>

<p>With regard to the “Land Dayaks” it is
stated, that “To the left of the Sirambau are
some very fine tapang trees, in which the bees
generally build their nests; they are considered
private property, and a Dayak from a neighboring
tribe venturing to help himself to some of
this apparently wild honey and wax would be
punished for theft.” This is the first hint that is
given of bees being considered in any respect as
private property, but the following passage
would seem to indicate that the domestication
of the honey-bee is not altogether unknown in
the island:&mdash;“During the night, our rest was
much disturbed by bees, which stung us several
times, and Mr. Lowe, with that acuteness which
never deserts him in all questions of natural
history, pronounced them to be the ‘tame’ bees,
the same as he had last seen thirteen years ago
among the Senah Dayaks, in Sarawak. About
midnight we were visited by a big fellow, who,
our guides assured us, wanted to pilfer; but we
found next morning that he had come to complain
of his hives having been plundered. On
inquiry, we discovered the man who had done
the deed. He was fined three times the value
of the damage, and the amount handed over to
the owner.”</p>

<p>During one of his adventurous expeditions up
the river Limbang, Mr. St. John found a Pakatan
named Japer, who accompanied him, a
storehouse of information. He had a thorough
faith in ghosts and spirits, and told of many an adventure
with them, and of the Antus who caused
the death of the wax-hunters, by pushing them
off the mengiris or tapang tree. When the unfortunate
men, from inefficient preparations, as
their companions not keeping up a great fire
under the trees to stupefy the bees, are so stung
as to let go their hold, the natural explanation
is never taken; they fly to their superstitions.
Japer’s nephew saw one of these tapang ghosts,
and managed to keep his eye upon him and prevent
him pushing him off, he came down without
accident, but without any wax. I suggested
that he invented the ghost to excuse his timidity,
which Japer thought probable. To-day we
passed one of these lofty trees bearing above
twenty bees’ nests, among them four old ones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
white with wax.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> As the country is full of
tapangs, in which alone do the bees build their
nests, the stories of the great amount of wax
formerly procured in this district may be true.
Why do the honey-bees generally build on one
particular tree? Its being the finest in the
forest is no good reason, perhaps there is something
enticing in the bark. I say ‘generally,’
because, though I have never seen their nests on
other trees, yet I have often come across them in
the crevices of rocks.</p>

<p>In a subsequent part of his journal of the same
expedition, our author says&mdash;“I never was in such
a country for bees, they everywhere swarm in the
most disagreeable manner, and ants and other insects
are equally numerous.” When on their return
and nearly starved, the party had “a very
happy find, for while passing under a fine tapang
tree we noticed the remains of a bees’ nest scattered
about, and every particle was eagerly appropriated.
From the marks around it appeared as if
a bear had climbed this lofty tree and torn down
the nest to be devoured by its young below, as
there were numerous tracks of the smaller
animals around, but whether the comb had
been sucked by the bears or not was very immaterial
to our men, who rejoiced in securing
the little honey still clinging to it.”</p>

<p>The party appears only once to have fallen
foul of a hornet’s nest. The encounter and its
results are thus described:&mdash;“It was in following
the bed of the Rawan that I was stung.
Notice was given by the guide to leave the direct
path, and we all did; but I suppose some one
disturbed the hornets, as they attacked me with
a ferocity that appears incredible: many flew
at me, but two fixed on my arms and stung me
through my double clothing. They poised themselves
a moment in the air, and then came on
with a rush which it was impossible to avoid.
The pain was acute, but I saved my face. I
tumbled down the steep bank in a moment, and
throwing aside rifle and ammunition, plunged
up to my eyes in a pool until the buzzing ceased
and the hornets had returned to their nests.
Some of my men were also stung; they squeezed
a little tobacco juice on the wounds, and they say
they felt no further inconvenience. I tried it
about an hour afterwards, but it did me no good.
I had no idea that the sting of this insect was so
severe; my right arm swelled up to double its
natural size and was acutely painful; now, on
the second day, it is much less so, but as the
swelling continues it is impossible to use it
much.”</p>

<p>That wild bees are exceedingly abundant
in the forests and jungles of Borneo may be inferred
from the foregoing passages as well as
from the numerous references to parties of native
“wax-hunters,” which occur in almost every
chapter of the work. Although no clue is given
by Mr. St. John to the identity of the Borneon
honey-bee, or any information as to the manner
in which it builds its nest, I am enabled in some
measure to supply the deficiency from other
sources.</p>

<p>Some half dozen years ago I received from Mr.
Charles Darwin, the distinguished naturalist, a
few specimens of bees named Apis testacea
(Smith), together with two pieces of their comb.
Although these had been brought by Mr. Alfred
B. Wallace, the celebrated traveller and author of
“The Malay Archipelago,” just published, from
the island of Timor in the Eastern Archipelago,
I believe them to be the same as those which are
indigenous in Borneo, so that there appears little
reason to doubt that these are the bees referred
to by Mr. St. John. On examination I
found them half as long again as Apis mellifica,
and their brood comb proportionably thicker.
They were in fact, a variety of the magnificent
Apis dorsata, which is described as flourishing
abundantly throughout the great Indian peninsula,
from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas, as
well as in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin subsequently introduced me to
Mr. Wallace, to whom I am indebted for the following
particulars:&mdash;“In Borneo and Timor the
wax forms an important article of commerce.
The combs hang on the under side of horizontal
limbs of lofty trees, often one hundred feet from
the ground.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>“I have seen three together as above, and they
are often four feet in diameter. The natives of
Timor I have seen take them. They climb up
a tree carrying a smoke torch made of a split
creeper bound up in palm leaves, and hanging
by a rope from their waist. They cover up their
body and hair carefully, but their arms and legs
are bare. The smoke directed on the comb
makes the bees fly off in a cloud as the man approaches.
He sweeps off the remainder with his
hand and then cuts off the comb with a large
knife, and lets it down to his companions below
by a thin cord. He is all the time surrounded by
a cloud of bees, and though the smoke no doubt
partly stupefies them, he must be severely stung.
While looking on from a considerable distance a
few came down and attacked me, and I did not
get rid of them till I was half a mile from the
place and had caught them all, one by one, in
my insect net. The sting is very severe. I
should imagine that in Timor the dry season
answers to our winter, as the drought is very
severe and much of the foliage is deciduous.
Eucalypti are the most common trees, and their
flowers I suspect supply the bees with their
honey. In Borneo combs are placed in a somewhat
similar manner, perhaps formed by the
same species. The only bee I have seen domesticated
in the East is one at Malacca, the natives
hang up bamboos and hollow logs for it, but it
is, I believe, not a true Apis, as it makes clusters
of large oval shells of black wax.”</p>

<p>I may add that the Timor bee was named
Apis testacea on account of its color, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
very light, and is, in fact, the only point in
which it differs from Apis dorsata. When
some years ago I compared the specimens in the
British Museum, I became impressed with the
idea that those which represented Apis testacea
were nothing more than newly-hatched and immature
specimens of Apis dorsata, and so
strongly did I urge my views upon Mr. Smith,
that I believe I almost induced him to doubt
the correctness of his own nomenclature, until
he was afterwards assured by Mr. Wallace himself,
that they were really mature and fully-developed
adult bees.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Devonshire Bee-keeper.</span></p>

<h2>Management of Bees in Winter.</h2>

<p class="hang">The following address on this subject was delivered by Mr.

appearance now will probably be all the more opportune
and serviceable.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>If there be no objection, I would like to reverse
the order of the time or statement of the
subject which I am expected to discuss, as the
spring management follows that of the winter.</p>

<p>The winter management, of a necessity, involves
some things that must be done in the fall;
and let me premise by saying that almost, if not
all of the operations and manipulations of bees,
are quite simple, when the natural habits and
requirements of the insect are well understood,
and with a reasonable amount of intelligence
and perseverance the object is accomplished.
Let me assure new beginners, and those that have
not begun, that the honey will much more
than compensate for the labor bestowed upon
them, as I know of no branch of rural pursuits
that, in dollars and cents, pays as well. And
the pleasure derived from a study of their nature
and habits, will far more than compensate, in a
scientific point of view, for all their stings.</p>

<p>In preparing for winter, of necessity it is incumbent
upon us to see or learn that they have
sufficient food to carry them through until they
can procure it for themselves;&mdash;say twenty or
twenty-five pounds if wintered in a special depository,
and twenty-five or thirty if wintered
on their summer stands.</p>

<p>We should then remove the surplus honey-boxes
as soon as the first hard frost; as, if they
remain on, the bees will the next day carry into
the breeding apartment all that is not capped
over; and I have seldom or never known a swarm
but what had enough in the body of the hive to
winter on, if they had stored any in the surplus
boxes.</p>

<p>Next, weigh one or more empty hives, to
which weight add, say ten pounds for weight of
bees, combs and bee bread; then the first cool
day proceed to weigh every swarm,&mdash;<i>no guessing
about it</i>. Mark the net weight of honey upon
the same corner or place on each hive.</p>

<p>Next, the first fine day commence to equalize
the amount of honey in the various swarms; if
in movable frames, taking from the heaviest and
giving to those that require feeding; if not in
movable frame hives, the light ones must be fed
in the evening with some of the various feeders,
and a good swarm will carry from five to eight
pounds to the combs in a night. They may be
fed on a syrup made of clarified sugar, but the
syrup should never, nor should honey be kept,
melted, dissolved, or fed from copper or brass
vessels, as it has been ascertained that verdigris
will cause foul brood.</p>

<p>We have now provided our bees with sufficient
food for winter, and why should we not? We
provide (or should), a sufficient supply for each
sheep, and certainly the profits of a swarm of
bees are as great as from a sheep&mdash;aye, and far
greater&mdash;and they do not require one-fourth part
of the care and attention.</p>

<p>I know of but one other preparation for wintering.
In almost any apiary there will be some
small swarms and some destitute of queens,
they may and should be doubled up, but no two
large swarms should be put together&mdash;they will
not do well.</p>

<p>We are now ready to put our bees into winter
quarters. The exact time for removing them to
the quarters cannot be now definitely determined.
If there are any small swarms, it will be well to
put them in somewhat earlier than the large
ones; as there is not as much animal heat, and
those upon the outside of the cluster become
chilled and perish; perhaps the first of December,
as a general rule, will be the correct time.</p>

<p>Now for the winter quarters. If they are wintered
on their summer stands, it would be much
better if the yard was enclosed with a high board
fence, or something to break off the winds. The
fly-holes should be nearly closed, so that it will
be one-half or three-fourths of an inch in size,
that it may not get stopped up with dead bees,
also that but a trifle of air may enter, thus preventing
much draft, and as upward ventilation
is almost absolutely necessary, there should be
openings in the top of the hive for the vapor to
escape, but the openings should be protected in
a manner to prevent the wind from driving into
them. There are many ways, as laying on five
or six inches of straw and placing the roof on it,
or a board and some weight to keep it in place,
or the cover to the honey boxes may be filled
with straw or some other substance that will absorb
all the moisture. This upward ventilation
should be closed, say the 15th of March, or after
the extreme cold weather is over. Thus I have
given you all that seems necessary, where they
are wintered on their summer stands.</p>

<p>When they are wintered in special depositories,
the preparation is the same, except that
no straw or other substance is necessary; but the
honey-board must be raised, say a quarter of an
inch, or if in common hives, the holes in the top
of the hive left open, the fly-hole the same as
above, the temperature kept between twenty-five
and forty-three by <i>thermometer</i>, the cellar or
room <i>perfectly</i> dark, and when you enter it, do
so with a lantern.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to give what I regard as
the best form and method of constructing a
special depository. Convenience to the apiary is
essential; it is as well, and perhaps better if we
can, to place it in the edge of a bank&mdash;as some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
root cellars are made&mdash;bluff, or side-hill. The
door should be at the lowest side, for the convenience
of entrance, as it is difficult to pass up
and down stairs with a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>The size of the room will of course be sufficiently
large to contain what bees we wish to
place therein. Sixteen feet by twenty, inside
measure, will hold one hundred and fifty swarms,
and leave ample alley room. The place should
be dry, there should be a double door, the room
<i>perfectly dark</i>, ceiling joists and a floor should
be laid over head, and eight or ten inches of sawdust,
tan-bark, dry marsh muck, or some nonconductor
placed on it before putting on the roof.
Four pipes, chimneys or tubes, made of ten or
twelve inch boards, should run from just below
the ceiling through the roof, and be of sufficient
length to exclude the light, say eight feet, on the
lower end of which there will be a simple slide
or valve. Place one in or near each corner of
the room. Thus we have the means distributed
for the ascent of the surplus heat, and the animal
heat of one hundred swarms is quite considerable,
and the great difficulty, if any, will be to
keep our room cool enough. To jump at the
conclusion that a room with thin walls will accomplish
it, will not answer; the great difficulty
is to have an even temperature. As, if our walls
are thin, the rays of the sun and warm air will
make the room too warm. In February, 1869, I
was under the necessity of doubling the thickness
of a ten inch wall on the south side.</p>

<p>We also place a pipe or tube quite around the
inside of the room upon the floor or ground (a
floor is quite unnecessary, worse than nothing,
for it makes a hiding place for rats and mice),
this tube may be made of foot boards, and inch
holes bored in it, once in two feet, for the equal
distribution of the cold and fresh air, when
needed. One end of this pipe must pass through
the wall, and must have a slide or valve at or
near the outer end.</p>

<p>If my room was at the bank or hill, the lower
side or end will of necessity be destitute of earth
banking, and we would make the wall at least
sixteen inches, filled as above with some nonconducting
substance, and dry marsh muck is
equal, if not superior, to almost any other substance,
except fine charcoal, and is easily procured.</p>

<p>A house built altogether upon a level surface,
with the walls of <i>sufficient thickness</i>, say eighteen
or twenty inches, will be equally good. The
cost of such a house as I have described cannot
be great. Most, if not all the labor, can be performed
by the apiarian.</p>

<p>This house will be found very convenient for
many other purposes in the spring and summer,
in the various operations, to wit: in overhauling
and examining the bees in the spring, as a window
sash may then be placed in the top of one of
the doors, and a stove placed within&mdash;thus I
have one arranged.</p>

<p>When you suspect there may be a material
change in the temperature of the room, look to
the thermometer; if too cold, close the valves, if
too warm open them more or less, as occasion
may require; if that is not sufficient, open the
door after dark, and close it again before light,
and if that is not sufficient, throw in and spread
over the floor a few bushels of snow or pounded
ice.</p>

<p>Many swarms will be benefited by being set
out on their summer stands at the time of
the January thaw, or in February, those that
are besmearing their hives, that they may discharge
themselves, which will cure most cases of
diarrhœa, or dysentery as it is called&mdash;though
there are real cases of diarrhœa, but not often.</p>

<p>Thus we have passed over the most essential
points in the wintering of bees. I will now proceed
to give some, if not all of the necessary
steps in their management in the spring.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give the exact date at which
they should be removed to their summer stands,
but whenever it is done, it is not at all important
that each swarm should be placed on the
identical stand it had the previous season, neither
is this precaution necessary if set out in the
winter.</p>

<p>In removing them from the cellar, it will first
be necessary to close up the fly-hole and remove
the chip or block from under the honey board&mdash;to
confine the bees in the hive.</p>

<p>Immediately after placing them upon their
summer stands, if housed in special depositories,
and perhaps about the same time or a trifle
earlier if wintered out, the bottom boards should
be cleaned of dead bees and other filth, it saves
the bees much labor and no doubt conduces to
their health.</p>

<p>As soon as they have become accustomed to
their new location, one of the most important
operations in bee management becomes necessary,
to wit, the thorough examination of the
swarm, for five purposes: First, to ascertain if
they have sufficient honey to carry them through;
of this we may judge with sufficient accuracy
from the appearance of the quantity. Be sure to
leave them enough, as the breeding season is now
considerably advanced. We must also regard
the size of the swarm, which will, of course, include
the quantity of brood now on hand. Secondly,
to see if they have too much honey. This
reason is almost equally important with the
other; it could be hardly conceived by the
novice how it was possible that a swarm of bees
could have too much honey. Well, we would
like to have you explain that, Mr. Lecturer, says
one&mdash;I think many. Well, be patient, my
friends, and we will make the attempt. First,
then, we will suppose the breeding chamber of the
hive is the proper size. This involves the question
as to what is the proper size. Well, there are
various opinions about it; but with some experience,
aided by a few simple figures, we may approximate
to it. We may assume that a vigorous
and healthy queen can and will lay three
thousand eggs a day; now, each square inch of
comb will contain fifty eggs, and fifty will go
into three thousand sixty times; it takes about
twenty-one days for the eggs to hatch; now
twenty-one times sixty is one thousand two hundred
and sixty: this would be a solid mass of
comb, larva and pupa; of a necessity, then, we
must add to the above one thousand two hundred
and sixty, half as much more room, six hundred
and thirty inches, making the inside of the hive
one thousand eight hundred and ninety cubic
inches. It will be well to add say half an inch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
more to the depth of the hive, as the bees seldom
build combs to within half an inch of the bottom
board. Well, suppose the hive is fourteen inches
each way (horizontal) we would thus add ninety-eight
inches more; this would give one thousand
nine hundred and eighty-eight, or for convenience,
two thousand cubic inches; two thousand
two hundred and eighteen and one-fifth cubic
inches are a bushel, which is most commonly
given as the proper size of the hive. Now, our
figures have given nearly that size, and worked
mathematically close, and giving a little leeway,
our hive will hold about a bushel. Let us recollect
this is the room required for breeding purposes.
We added two hundred inches, and will
suppose that will be filled with pollen and honey;
now, if these premises be correct, we start in the
spring with the size of our hive much reduced by
being filled with honey, as we have but two hundred
cubic inches for that purpose and the bee-bread.
Can we now see that a swarm of bees
may have too much honey in the breeding chamber?
Still we must leave enough at this examination
to carry them safe through till an abundant
supply can be obtained from the blossoms.
Suppose, therefore, we leave from thirty to fifty
pounds of honey in the hive, is it not evident we
have trenched that amount of space upon the
breeding territory? Then, if the season is a good
one for honey, this room is constantly being diminished
by the bees depositing honey in the
cells as soon as the brood leaves, the result of
which will be your young swarms will be too
small, and by winter the old ones, for the want of
breeding room, are too few to raise sufficient
animal heat to winter. Even if the proper amount
only is left in the hive in the spring, and the season
is a good one for honey, the hives should be
examined, say the first day of August, and the
outside sheets that are filled with honey and have
no brood in them, be removed, and empty sheets
or frames placed in the centre of the hive that
the queen may have more room.</p>

<p>Thirdly. We examine the hive to see if there is
too much drone comb (and any is too much in a
large apiary) for if you remove all, the bees will
find means to raise drones enough, as in a hive
with the ordinary quantity there are probably
enough for an apiary of fifty or seventy-five
swarms.</p>

<p>Fourthly. We examine the hive to determine
if the queen is living, and if so, if she may not
be a drone layer. The question will be asked by
some how we determine if she is living, or is a
drone layer. If there is no queen there will be
no brood, and <i>vice versa</i>, and if the brood be <i>all</i>
drone, there would be no doubt of her being a
drone layer. In either case, the swarm should
be doubled up with a swarm that has a normal
queen; the drone layer should first be killed.</p>

<p>Fifthly. In performing these examinations it
is an excellent plan to transfer each swarm to a
clean hive, as the rabbets have often become
partially filled with propolis or gum, as are also
the ends of the frames covered with it, and sometimes
the hive may want repairs.</p>

<p>We have seen that this examination is one of
paramount necessity. The better place to operate
is perhaps in a room or place with a single window,
or a half window is better, and the room
should be so warm that the bees will not chill
upon the window. It should be so arranged that
the bees that gather thereon may be frequently
liberated; the weather should be sufficiently
mild for them to fly from the place to the hive.
A decoy hive should be set upon the stand, with
a few pieces of comb in it; the decoy hive should
be of the same color as the one being operated
upon. An active person can examine twenty
hives in a day with an assistant. This examination
may be performed out of door at the stands,
were it not for the fact that it is a season of the
year when the robbers are most persistent. In
performing these operations, it will be found advantageous
to blow in a little smoke at the time
of opening the hive.</p>

<p>We now have our bees in clean hives with
plenty of honey&mdash;not too much&mdash;and without
too much drone comb. But perhaps a few queens
may have died a natural death during the winter,
or there may be some drone layers. In either
case, the bees should be put with another swarm.
This may done in various ways; the safest, perhaps,
for the uninitiated, would be to drive the
swarm from the hive without a queen into the
other, by first blowing in a little smoke, also
sprinkle in a trifle of scented syrup, and then
drumming; and after they are driven the swarm
had better be removed to a perfectly dark room
or cellar say for a week, or remove them to a distance
of at least a mile for a week. This removing
should be done instanter. An additional
precaution would be to place the one hive above
the other preparatory to driving, with a wire
cloth between them, say for forty-eight hours,
that each may have the same scent.</p>

<p>It is often the case that many swarms are
small in the spring; then comes the question,
what is it best to do with them? I am of the
opinion that the better plan is to feed them, to
stimulate the queen to breeding. Commencing
the 15th of March, give the swarm from three to
four tablespoonfuls of honey every day, or every
other day, except the days they gather from
flowers, will answer; but they must be watched
closely to see if they have plenty of honey in the
combs for their brood, and they consume much
more than we would suspect; as, for illustration,
suppose a hive to be filled with larva capped over,
can any person tell me how that amount or mass
of animal matter can be brought into that form
without an equivalent in weight of liquid sweet
(honey or sugar syrup) and pollen, for which we
substitute in our stimulating process in the
spring unbolted rye flour, placed where it will
be protected from wind and water. They may
be easily enticed to it by placing a little honey in
the vessel.</p>

<p>Another method of procedure is to double up
the weak ones. Another still is to equalize
them by taking a sheet of brood that is hatching
from a large swarm and giving it to the small
one.</p>

<p>One of these methods is very important, as
after all the apparent secret of bee management
the greatest secret lies in keeping the swarms
strong.</p>

<p>The bees in small swarms are all compelled to
stay at home to keep up sufficient animal heat to
keep the brood warm, perhaps scarcely gathering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
honey enough to stimulate the queen to lay;
and if she did lay up to her full capacity, there
are not bees enough to keep the brood warm.</p>

<p>Another advantage in having strong swarms is
to avoid the miller or wax moth.</p>

<p>I lay down the proposition that the moth <i>never
materially injured a good swarm</i> in a decently
made hive.</p>

<p>In this connection, I lay down another proposition,
that without some explanation may seem
as strange as the one above alluded to, (that a
swarm of bees may have too much honey.) I
think I may assert that the moth is or may be an
advantage. We always act from one or more
motives moving us to a particular point. Amongst
other things, I stated that the moth never <i>materially</i>
injured a <i>good</i> swarm of bees. Now,
one of the requisites of a good one is strength.
Let us see if the moth may not be an advantage.
Most bee-keepers have had in their yard say at
least two swarms of that size that all they could
do would be to get themselves into good condition
as to numbers and stores for the coming
winter, without giving the owner a young swarm
or an ounce of surplus honey, and at the same
time they were very much exposed to the moth
and stood a good chance to be destroyed by
them, because there are not bees enough to
guard the unprotected combs.</p>

<p>Now, we will put these two swarms together,
and see what the result will be; we will have a
swarm strong enough to guard against the moth,
strong enough to keep a large quantity of brood
warm, by which it will be strong enough to
throw off a swarm in good season, and if it is a
fair season for honey we may expect twenty-five
pounds of surplus honey from the mother swarm.
And what have we lost? a queen. The comb we
will preserve in a cool, dry place, and give them
to the young swarm. Has the moth in this view
been a benefit?</p>

<p>We have now our hives properly examined,
those that need it fed, the honey taken away if
too much, the queenless doubled up, the weak
stimulated, equalized or doubled up. There are
now but few things to be done, the hive should
be made as tight as possible with no upward
ventilation, the fly-hole opened but a trifle, and as
the swarm increases, which we can determine by
the steam, or rather dampness, on the bottom
board at the fly-hole in the morning, we will enlarge
the fly-hole.</p>

<p>We will next place a trough in the centre of
the yard and keep water in it, and to prevent the
drowning of the bees will cover its surface with
corn-cobs, and occasionally exchange them for
fresh ones as they become sour in time.</p>

<p>Now we feel pretty sure thus far we have
warded off that scare crow, “luck.”</p>

<p>I think of but one other duty we can perform
for our and their benefit, that is within the task
assigned me, to wit, that of placing the surplus
honey boxes on the hive. Mr. Quinby, I think
is the only writer that tells us the proper time,
namely, when the hive is full of brood and honey
below. As they only go into the boxes for the
want of room below, and not always then, they
should not be put on much sooner, as it enlarges
the space to be kept warm by the animal heat,
<i>all of which is needed up to that time</i>.</p>

<h2>Wintering Bees.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>:&mdash;I believe the inventors of all
hives claim&mdash;each for his special invention&mdash;better
wintering qualities “than any other hive
in use.” But many of them, after being tested,
prove to be no better than any old common hive,
from the fact that they are not constructed on
the right principle. When I constructed the
hive described in the Journal for July, it was
my intention to make it one of the best for
wintering bees that had ever been devised;
and I have yet to find the man who has seen
and examined it, who says it is not upon the
right principle for that purpose. If we can have
a hive constructed on the right principle for
successful wintering of bees, storing honey, and
allowing of as much room for surplus honey-boxes
as the largest stock needs, it is certainly
an improvement over anything yet constructed
in the shape of a bee-hive. I claim that my
hive combines more good qualities and fewer
<i>bad</i> ones, than any hive now extant.</p>

<p>When I commenced to write, I did not intend
to say anything in favor of this hive. Those who
have used it will say enough in its favor. I will
now give my plan for wintering bees in it, which
I can do in very few words; and it will not take
longer to prepare one of them for wintering,
than it will to read this article.</p>

<p>First, make the winter passages through the
combs. This I do by taking a stick twenty
inches long and three-fourths of an inch wide,
made sharp at one end, and slowly worm it
through the combs, from front to rear of the
hive. If a hive be examined, twenty-four hours
after this has been done, the bores will be found
as round and as smooth as though the bees had
made them. Next remove the board from the
top of the brood chamber, and cover the frames
with any old rug, coat, or woolen cloth of any
kind; and, although it is not necessary, it will
be found a good plan to remove the sides of the
brood chamber, and cover them the same as the
top; or they can be covered with cotton cloth,
leaving the surplus box holes open as a means
of ventilation, and at the same time keeping the
bees confined to the combs and from going into
the outer hive. I did not remove the woolen
cloths from the tops of my hives this season,
and the only ventilation my hives have had
during the <i>very</i> hot weather was through the
entrance. There was no melting down of combs
as in the shallow form of the Langstroth hive.</p>

<p>The entrance should be closed during the
winter, so as to leave only about one inch space
between the blocks. A stock of bees will not
smother in this hive, even if it be covered up in
snow all winter; but the ventilating holes in the
cap must be left open during the winter. In
most of the hives sent out, I left a hole in front
of the brood chambers to make the winter
passages through.</p>

<p>In the spring the brood chamber can be
lifted off the bottom boards and cleaned of bees
and droppings; and I have done this without
even disturbing the bees.</p>

<p>Three years ago I gave a plan for wintering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
bees in the shallow form of Langstroth hive.
Many who tested that plan, have written to me
that it worked well. I think the plan a good
one, and hope some one who has a copy of it
will send it to the editor of the Journal to have
it republished. I will guarantee that all who
try it will be pleased with the plan.</p>

<h2>Italian Queens.</h2>

<p>I wish to thank the Rev. E. L. Briggs for his
excellent article upon the permanency and purity
of Italian bees, published in the August
number of the Bee Journal, although I cannot
concur in all his conclusions, nor accept some
portions of his theory; but it is on a subject that
will soon be of absorbing interest to every bee-keeper.</p>

<p>To the central idea of his article, that our aim
should be <i>perfection</i>, undoubtedly all will cordially
assent, while few will adopt it practically,
for obvious reasons. Bee-keepers, as a class,
have neither time, taste, nor inclination to attain
the highest results in this direction; though
they will seek to improve their stock, provided
it can be done cheaply and without much trouble.
It is well known that a <i>cross</i>&mdash;all things
being equal&mdash;invariably improves stock. It
therefore follows that the introduction of impure
Italians even, will have a beneficial effect
and thus help the matter, if for no other reason
than simply crossing and mixing the blood.</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs will admit that comparatively
few persons will pay $8.00 or more for tested
queens to breed from or to Italianize their stocks
with. And until such queens of undoubted
purity can be afforded at a much lower price
than that, the great mass of bee-keepers will
continue to regard well marked Italian queens
at $2.50 each, as a great blessing, inasmuch as
they vastly improve the general status of the
bee, even if not quite reaching the point of perfection.</p>

<p>Mr. Alley, to whom Mr. Briggs refers, has
furnished me with queens perfectly satisfactory,
being as finely marked as any I ever saw, and
their workers and daughters are “chips of the
old block.” Certainly the introduction of such
blood will not cause deterioration in all or any
of those qualities that a progressive bee-keeper
delights in. It is pleasant to have bees gentle
and harmless; but when that quality is obtained
at the expense of activity in breeding or working,
it becomes an unprofitable luxury.</p>

<p>The question that is so often asked&mdash;“Are
pure Italians superior to hybrids, as workers
and breeders?” must be satisfactorily settled by
breeders of pure Italians, before bee-keepers
generally will accept fully the conclusions of
Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p>My own experience has satisfied me that
hybrids are far superior to the pure Italians, in
every quality save that of gentleness. Possibly
my queens may not have been absolutely pure,
yet they conform to the best marks as described
by Quinby and others. Those of my stocks that
are unquestionably hybrid have given the best
satisfaction in every respect. Others assure me
of similar experience. Will some one explain
this fact?</p>

<p>In view of it all, I can but regard a general
crossing of Italians and blacks, as of immense
advantage to bees and bee-keepers, and I hope
and trust that friend Alley will continue to distribute,
far and near, by scores and hundreds,
those large, prolific and beautiful queens at
$2.50 each.</p>

<h2>Queen-Breeding.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>:&mdash;Criticisms based on substantial
facts, courteously worded, made in a spirit
of kindness and a desire to benefit the world,
are opportune and of great value. But when
made merely for the purpose of “showing
off,” or of filling up space in an article, thereby
damaging the reputation of any person without
just cause, based on no facts, and unsupported
by even a shadow of proof, they tend to mislead,
and are an injury to the author, the person criticised,
and the public generally.</p>

<p>On page 38 of the August No. of the Journal
in an article written by Mr. E. L. Briggs, is a
direct attack on one of your correspondents,
who for years has been engaged in the queen-breeding
business, and who, by devoting his
whole time thereto, is enabled to supply his customers
at very low prices. And the only cause
given for this attack is that he supplies the bee
fraternity at $2.50 for a warranted queen, and
has four hundred orders at that price.</p>

<p>Now if Mr. Alley can afford to rear queens
and sell them at $2.50, and his customers do not
find fault, whose business is it? And is it just
the thing for any one to assume that his queens
are not pure, without showing the proof thereof?
I think not.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Alley and his reputation as a man
and a dealer in queens, I will say, in order that
the many readers of your Journal who do not
know him, may get at the facts, that I have for
a long time been personally acquainted with
him, and have always found him just and honorable
in his dealings. I also know that he
takes great pains to obtain the best stock to
breed from, by purchasing imported queens, and
continually procuring from reputable dealers,
such queens as are of known purity, in order to
avoid too close breeding. These facts, in connection
with the fact that he is in a locality
where all the bees, for miles around his apiary,
have been Italianized by him, show whether the
assumed idea in Mr. Briggs’ article has a shadow
of foundation. Now, shall any one of the queen-raising
brotherhood assume that a man is a
sharper who sells queens for $2.50, without
proving that the purchasers thereof have been
swindled? For one, I answer no! And if I can
buy pure queens of Mr. Alley for $2.50, I shall
not send to Mr. Briggs, and pay him from $8 to
$10, even for his four or more banded mothers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>I have written this article in justice to Mr.
Alley, and could if necessary bring any amount
of proof to substantiate it; but thinking this
enough, I remain always for the right.</p>

<h2>About Italian Queens, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>Mr. E. L. Briggs seems to pitch into cheap
queen raisers, and Alley in particular (at least
so Alley understands it, although he mentions
no names). I cannot let such remarks pass unnoticed.
I would have Mr. Briggs understand
that I spare no pains to procure the best breeding
queens imported into this country. I have paid
from $5 to $20 and upwards for Italian queens,
and have never as yet found among my purchases
when received any queens superior to those of
my own raising. My only object in purchasing
queens, is to avoid in-and-in breeding. I am very
careful to select the largest, handsomest, and
most prolific queens to breed from, both for
young queens and drones. I do not doubt that
I ship queens now and then that are not up to
the standard, and so do all other breeders who
do not test their queens before sending. But in
every case, I will send other queens, or give satisfaction
in some way. The stock I now have
produce as large, prolific, and handsome queens
as Mr. B. or any other man ever saw. Any
queen that I send out is worth all I charge for
her, even if she has perchance mated with a
black drone. I pay the highest figure for my
breeding queens, and now have queens of my
own raising that I would not sell for fifty dollars.
If Mr. B. would like to purchase some Italian
queens, and thinks they would be any better by
paying eight or ten dollars for them, instead of
two dollars and a half, I can accommodate him
in that line; and if he has any such queens as
he describes, I will take the lot at the price he
has stated, viz.: eight or ten dollars. Now here
is a chance for a trade! I know that some bee-keepers
think that my queens are not worth
much, because I sell them so low: but if it will
do them any good to know how it is that I can
afford to sell at such low prices, I will make it
known.</p>

<p>I have all I can do in the summer to raise
queens and reply to all the letters I receive; and
I find it quite business enough to keep two
hundred (200) nucleus hives in full operation.
Talk about boasting of orders for four hundred
queens! Why I have orders for more than
seven hundred on my books, and they are still
coming in by every mail. I was expecting to
raise and ship one thousand queens this season,
but cannot do it. My orders began to come in
as early as last December, and one man ordered
fifty as early as last March. Nearly all the
orders I have received this season came from
persons I supplied last season, and their friends
who have seen my stock in the apiaries of former
purchasers. I have plenty of letters speaking
in the highest terms of my queens; and many
of them, like Dr. Barnard, say they are much
better than those they paid twenty dollars for.
Let me say here that I sent Dr. B. his queens
last fall, and the first I heard from him since,
I saw in the American Bee Journal&mdash;it was of
course no pre-arranged plan for him to blow Mr.
Alley’s stock of Italians.</p>

<p>I paid a certain party in June last ten dollars
for a queen. A few days ago I received her, and
I may safely say I never shipped a queen as poor
in appearance. Nor was there any excuse for
the party sending me such a queen, as she was
raised last season and was taken from a full stock
when sent to me. I guarantee to send out just
as good queens for two dollars and a half.</p>

<p>I do not want the reader to suppose that this
article is intended as an advertisement. That is
far from my design; but I feel obliged to make
this statement in self defence.</p>

<p>Last winter I read an advertisement in a
western paper, from the pen of a high-price queen
dealer, in which he said that he did not believe
that good queens could be raised and sold for
$2.50. Now, the same person has advertised them
at a figure even lower than that. I can afford
to raise and sell good pure queens for the price
I am charging, and mean to do so as long as I
can find purchasers for them, which judging
from the demand for them, will be some time
yet.</p>

<p>I have, within a few weeks, bought seven queens
from some of these high-priced queen breeders,
none of which are any larger or handsomer than
the stock I now have; nor do I believe that their
progeny will prove to be any better. Only this
morning I received three queens from such a
breeder, two of which I returned by the next
mail. I do not want any stock of that kind.</p>

<p>I do not know who Mr. Briggs is, nor whether
he is “blowing” for himself or not; and I do not
understand his object in sending such an article
to the Journal as appeared last month over his
name. If he intends to build up a trade at the
expense of other people by underrating their
stock, I, for one, would like to know it.</p>

<p>I have plenty of letters from purchasers,
“blowing up” some of these high-price queen
breeders; and I presume they have some of the
same kind, giving Alley what he deserves and
perhaps more than is due to him. But let that
be as it may, all I have to say is this&mdash;if any man
has a queen purchased from Alley, that he does
not like, let him return her at once, or ever after
hold his peace.</p>

<p>Mr. Langstroth has written to me several
times that they never yet imported a queen that
would invariably duplicate herself. Who is the
best authority on this point&mdash;Mr. L. or Mr. B.?
I have this information not only from Mr. L.,
but from other importers also. I know nothing
about Morgan mares nor of certain breeds of pigs;
but I have several years’ experience with Italian
bees, and profess to know something about them.
Those who breed Italian queens, and charge
high prices for them too, will acknowledge that
not more than one queen in fifty is as good as
those which Mr. B. has pictured in the last
number of the Journal; and he may bet a high
figure that no worker bee in the country ever
showed four bands. This article has grown
pretty long, and I do wish Mr. B. would stir one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
up when the weather is cooler, and we have
more leisure for rejoinder&mdash;say next winter.</p>

<h2>Bees in Central New Hampshire.</h2>

<p>The limited number of bee-keepers that are
found in this section of the country is sufficient
evidence that the securing of honey is not here
regarded as the royal road to wealth. Many a
farmer may have some four or five hives, which
are but a small taxation upon his time. From
them he is furnished with a luxury which if not
secured in this manner, probably no money would
purchase.</p>

<p>Last year, (1869,) we secured five hundred
pounds in boxes&mdash;beginning in the spring with
twelve colonies. The harvest began on the 14th
or 15th of June, and closed the 16th of July.
The season was considered by bee-keepers generally
in this section of the country, as being a
very poor one. But few hives yielded any surplus
honey, save those that received extra attention.</p>

<p>On the 12th of November we placed fifteen
colonies in the cellar, where they remained till
the 9th of April, 1870. In our opinion, proper
ventilation is the necessary lesson to learn in
order to secure success; and every man should
be fully persuaded in his own mind what course
is best for him to pursue. We have had some
experience with corn-cobs, paper coverings, wire
screens, straw mats, and old carpets. With us,
the last of these articles proves to be the most
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Thirteen colonies passed the five months incarceration
and came out fresh and fair. The
remaining two nearly failed us, as we attempted
to have them live without much change of air.
Those hives from which we removed the honey-boards
and covered the frames with two thicknesses
of good woolen carpets, all came out in
the spring beautifully neat and clean. We shall
anticipate the same favorable results for the
coming winter.</p>

<p>As the surplus honey harvest for 1870 has
already passed, we can begin to count our actual
gains. Comb-building began about the first of
June, and ceased the first week in July. Since
that date very little honey has been deposited in
the boxes, even when the bees were furnished
with nice frames of comb. The white clover
blossomed very profusely, and ripened rapidly,
and the bees were thus soon deprived of their
largest and best harvest field.</p>

<p>Thus far we have secured somewhat over four
hundred pounds of No. 1 honey, and shall probably
realize enough more to make <i>five hundred</i>
pounds, when all the boxes are removed and the
hives taken up that are not wanted for winter.
Thus far we have not succeeded so well as we
have wished in combining colonies. We would
not destroy any with brimstone, because that is
so very unkind; but when we add colony to
colony many bees will kill each other. Tobacco
smoke and fragrant waters have at times failed
to produce harmony of feeling. Perhaps it would
be better to sell the colonies we do not wish to
keep.</p>

<p>We have, however, reason to be thankful for
the sweet blessing we have already received, and
are also thankful that our friends, west and
south, are having such bountiful returns.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, we have just returned from a
visit to the school. The scholars were engaged
in reading their themes, it being Saturday afternoon.
Among the many subjects, one little girl
had selected the Honey Bee. It interested us so
much that we have taken the liberty to send you
a copy, that you may see what one of our little
Shaker girls, nine years of age, has written</p>

<h3>ABOUT BEES.</h3>

<p>“I love bees, because they make honey; but
I do not love them sometimes, because they sting
me, and that I do not like, though I like their
honey. I have felt a sting from a honey bee,
and I never want to have one again, for I know
how it feels. It smarts well, indeed it does. A
bee is like a little girl, because it does good when
it wants to, and when it does not it will sting
you. Now, scholars, I will just tell you not to
’flict a bee, if you don’t want it to sting you. It
is like a girl, for if you ’flict her, she will be unkind
to you, and you must not ’flict her. This
is all I have to write about the bee.”&mdash;C.</p>

<p>The Journal as a welcome visitor arrives while
we are engaged writing this communication;
and the pages tell of great and precious treasures.
As time passes on we hope to be able to
write of more bountiful harvests. We have in
anticipation the simon pure Italian Bee, to take
the place of our blacks and hybrids; and extended
fields of Alsike clover, instead of the antiquated
red. In that day of bounty and beauty,
we shall hope to write temptingly to our worthy
editor.</p>

<h2>Natural, Prolific, Hardy Queens.<br />

<small>PART 2.</small></h2>

<p class="caption">(<i>Continued from July Number, page 11.</i>)</p>

<p>In early spring, or at any time desirable, proceed
to stimulate a selected colony with liquid
feed. “Warm syrup or strained honey, is
the best for the purpose;” placing alternately
empty combs or combs full of brood, from other
hives, until your hive is full; or by the removal
of one or more colonies, on each side of the selected
one, the worker bees from one or more
hives, can be thrown into the selected hive, and
so stimulate the swarming fever or impulse.
Proceed now as recommended in the July number,
page 11, when the bees will commence building
queen cells. The bee-keeper will thus secure
from ten to sixty queen cells per week. During
my experiments, each weekly robbing only stimulated
the bees to greater exertions to secure a
queen. Proceed thus until the desired number
of queen cells are secured, or the bees swarm.
If they should swarm before a sufficient number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of queen cell’s are secured, and it is desirable to
still breed from the same queen, secure her and
introduce her to a colony that has not swarmed,
and proceed as before. Or, better still, introduce
her to a colony making preparations to
swarm. Before introducing her, destroy all
queen cells that have eggs or larva in them;
then cell building will proceed as before. A
swarm under the swarming impulse will communicate
it to a strange queen introduced to them;
or a queen under the swarming impulse, “and
not satisfied,” will communicate it to any populous
colony to which she may be introduced.</p>

<h2>Natural and prolific hardy Queens.</h2>

<p>We are all more or less disposed to regard our
own ideas as indisputable.</p>

<p>Mr. Quinby for example, praises his new hive,
and his queen yard. I have experimented with
both, and both are now in my barn, waiting to
be split up for kindling wood.</p>

<p>Mr. John M. Price, in the July number of the
Bee Journal, condemns all artificially raised
queens. But <i>rassurez vous</i>, friend queen-breeders,
I come to prove to friend Price, that
he has misconceived the reason of his bad luck
in raising artificial queens.</p>

<p>When I commenced to introduce Italian bees
in my apiary, six years ago, I received from one
of our best queen-breeders a very nice looking
queen. She was very yellow from the waist to
the tip of the abdomen. Well, I raised a number
of queens to get drones, and next season I
raised some more, from the same queen, to
replace the misallied queens. But lo, one-fourth
of my young queens were either crippled, or
drone laying, or laying non-hatching eggs. Yet
these queens were as yellow as their mother, and
it seemed as if the brighter they looked, the
poorer they were.</p>

<p>Then my first imported queens came. They
were not yellow, but dark. The first rings of the
abdomen were leather-colored, the last were entirely
black or nearly so. I wrote to Dr. Blumhof,
reproaching him for having sent me so dark
queens. He replied that all the healthier queens
in Italy are dark, and that it was well ascertained
there, that the light-colored queens were
not so good as the dark. The light-colored
queens, added the Doctor, seem to have the
chlorosis. Prof. Mona told the same thing to
Mr. A. Grimm, when he was in Italy. See
<i>American Bee Journal</i>, vol. III. From this we can
guess that the selecting of the brightest yellow
queens for breeders, is one of the causes of the
failure of the queens raised. But in-and-in
breeding is another, and according to my experience,
a main cause of weakness.</p>

<p>As soon as my first imported queens were on
hand, I commenced raising queens from them,
and from that time forward I raised artificial
queens every year from newly imported queens.
Those queens mate with drones from queens of
the preceding year’s importation, and so on. I
do not care for the color of these queens, but not
one of them is crippled or proves to be a poor
layer.</p>

<p>My five best stocks this year, all have artificial
queens. Three of these queens are with swarms
of last year. I hived them in one of friend
Price’s hives. These swarms are better than
the three original stocks they came from, though
these latter have raised natural queens in the
height of the swarming season, as friend Price
prefers they should. The five stocks referred to
gave me from seventy to one hundred pounds
each, of box honey. I suppose I should be
thought very <i>exigeant</i> if I were not content with
such results, in so dry a season as this.</p>

<p>Why does friend Price imagine that artificially
raised queens are not so good as natural ones?
Probably, because the bees, in order to obtain
queens sooner, chose grubs already several days
old, instead of selecting newly laid eggs, from
which to raise queens. I have watched that
very closely, and could see no appreciable difference.
A stock rendered queenless will raise
queens maturing at different periods, some
hatching in from nine to twelve or fourteen
days, and sometimes not till sixteen days after.
If the above theory were correct, the earlier
hatching queens should be the poorer, for they
come from grubs three or four days old. Yet
such is not the case&mdash;those queens are as good
as any.</p>

<p>If that theory proved to be true, it would still
be an easy matter to prevent the evil results apprehended.
We could destroy the two or three
first-capped queen cells; or force the bees to
raise queens from the egg, by a method far more
easy than friend Price’s. Insert in your chosen
stock a frame, containing empty worker comb,
placing it between two frames containing brood.
In three days, if the bees find honey in the fields,
the cells of the worker comb will be supplied
with eggs. Then remove the queen and all the
brood combs, except the one containing the
eggs. The bees will thus have eggs only from
which to raise queens, and <i>all</i> your young queens
will necessarily be started <i>ab ovo</i>. I guess this
method is as good as, and more simple than, that
of friend Price.</p>

<p>I am not a queen-breeder. That business
does not suit me, for it is a source of too much
vexation. I have repeatedly imported queens,
but I lost money and suffered so much in that
business, that I think my sufferings will pay for
all my sins in the other world. I am thus
altogether disinterested in this matter of breeding
queens.</p>

<p>On this topic, my advice to apiarians is&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Do not look for yellow queens, for they
are not as good as dark ones.</p>

<p>2d. Take care to avoid too close in-and-in
breeding.</p>

<p>Let us also remark, that many bee-keepers find
that the half-blood Italian bees, are better than
the pure ones. Why? Simply because the in-and-in
breeding the race of their queens was
subject to for some generations, was broken
by the alliance with black drones. But the
alliance of the Italian queens with Italian drones
remotely bred, would doubtless give as good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
progeny, while preserving the purity of the
stock.</p>

<p>Let us remark also, that Nature in ordering
for the queens the wedding flight, obviously had
in view the avoidance of in-and-in breeding.</p>

<p>3d. Choose the colony having the purest
queen, and the most fertile, from which to provide
the queens cells, and distribute in small
nuclei when sealed. No matter if the queen is
dark. In good seasons the queens raised in
small nuclei are as good as those raised in full
stocks.</p>

<h2>Artificial Queens.</h2>

<p>In the July No. of the Journal. Mr. John M.
Price contributed an article on “Natural, Hardy
and Prolific Queens,” which was no doubt his
conviction of the truth of the matter at the
time; but as it does not agree with my experience,
I will give the other side of the question.</p>

<p>If I understand his theory, it is that queens
reared in stocks deprived of their queen when
not under the “swarming impulse,” are smaller,
less prolific and shorter lived than what are
termed <i>natural queens</i>. I am fully aware that
Mr. Price does not stand alone on said theory,
and yet I believe it to be an error.</p>

<p>For the sake of distinguishing, we will state
that queens bred in full stocks from which the
mother queen led forth a swarm, or queens
which were <i>started</i> while the old queen remained
in the hive, are <i>natural</i> queens, and all others
<i>artificial</i>. I have both kinds in my apiary, and
have had for several years, and can see no difference
in their size, beauty, fertility or longevity.
I have repeatedly kept artificial queens
until they were three years old, and had one
very prolific queen which died in March last,
being then three years and nine months old. I
left her as an experiment, to see what age she
would attain; but my practice is to remove
queens in their second or third year. Of course
a few die before they are two years old, for
they are not exempt from the ills that bee
“flesh is heir to.” But that four or five in
succession should pass off the stage of action in
a single stock in one season, is something before
unheard of. I do not know what effect
brother P.’s revolvable, reversible, double-cased
hive <i>might</i> have upon the tender life of a young
queen; but it seems to have been most disastrous,
for we have no such work here in the
old Keystone State.</p>

<p>It is a matter of very great importance in the
success of an apiary, that our stocks are supplied
with the <i>right kind</i> of queens, and in order to
effect this desirable result, something more is
necessary to a full understanding of the subject,
than simply to know that bees, when deprived
of their queen, will attempt to supply her place.
I find little difficulty in rearing <i>fine</i> queens,
with the following conditions: 1st. a suitable
queen mother; 2d. fair weather and good
pasturage; 3d. a full stock, in which honey and
pollen are abundant (not a nucleus where starvation
stares them in the face). It is a settled
point with me, that the production of queens is
a matter wholly under the control of the worker
bees; and we lack evidence that a queen <i>ever</i>
lays an egg in a royal cell. If the bee is guided
by instinct <i>alone</i>, and the production of a queen
depended on the depositing of a <i>peculiar</i> egg by
the queen in a royal cell (an egg, differing from
the worker or drone eggs), it would follow that,
on the loss or removal of the queen when no
such eggs existed in the hive, no young queens
could be produced.</p>

<p>Small queens may be produced in nuclei where
the requisite food is limited, and where from
want of bees the larva is exposed to repeated
changes of temperature, which is detrimental.
When reared in full stocks in times of great
scarcity, nearly the same results follow.</p>

<p>There is another important point, namely the
<i>proper age</i> for the mother bee. In breeding all
our domestic animals, regard is always had (and
wisely we think) to the age of the parents. It
may be thought that the life of the bee is so
short that it would allow but little latitude in
this direction; but it should not be forgotten
that the queen usually lives three and sometimes
four years, during which time there is doubtless
a period of fertility and hardiness, or power of
endurance, not common to the whole of her life.
Just what that period is, I am not prepared to
say; but the rapid advancement of apiarian
science will doubtless solve the problem. I am
satisfied, however, that queens bred from <i>young</i>
queens are not equal, in several desirable points,
to those bred from mothers a year old. In experimenting
with black bees, I became satisfied
on this point several years ago. I have never
known a <i>young</i> black queen, after becoming fertile,
to lead out a swarm, no matter how populous
the stock might be; and indeed apiarians
have considered it the best method of preventing
swarming, in order to secure surplus honey,
to remove the old queen and install one of the
current year. (It is ahead of Quinby’s queen
yard). We reason from this, that their instinct
teaches them that they are <i>unfit</i> for queen
mothers. This would not, perhaps, hold good
in the high temperature of southern latitudes,
which tends to the earlier maturity of all animal
life. With the Italian bees it is somewhat different,
for young queens produce drone eggs,
and they do sometimes lead out swarms, yet
they are not so liable to do so as older queens.</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Benedict tells us he produced six
generations of queens in a single season, but
does not give us the result, further than that he
thought he improved his bees in color.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that the men who raise
queens from March to October, have cheap
queens and sell them by the hundred. But I
am one to say that no genuine lover of our pets
who duly considers consequences, would proceed
thus. And now, Mr. Editor, I wish to say in
conclusion, that of my 125 queens about one-fourth
are <i>natural</i> and the balance artificial
queens, and if Mr. Price, or “any other man”
will, upon examination, decide correctly, by
size or fertility (amount of brood), which are of
the former and which of the latter class, he may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
pick out ten as large and yellow queens as he
<i>ever saw</i>, and I will make him a present of the
same, and will warrant that, if artificial, they
shall be as productive as he wishes them.</p>

<p>NB.&mdash;I have no cheap queens for sale.</p>

<h2>Novice.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bee Journal:</span>&mdash;That flood of honey
that was driving us so, when we last wrote you,
has ceased, and we are having a resting spell.</p>

<p>About the 18th of July the basswood failed,
and we were obliged to desist, mostly on account
of the neighbors’ black bees desperately attempting
to rob our hives when we opened them. In
fact, the upper stories of our Langstroth hives are
all full now, but before we can empty two hives
the black bees are so thick as to threaten demoralization
to our whole apiary. Though the Italians
will sometimes sting a pint of them to death
around a single hive, not an Italian can be found
among the slain.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, to which we have repeatedly
called the attention of others, many are
busy in accusing the Italians of driving the innocent
common bees out of the land. One
neighbor in particular, who cannot afford to
take the Bee Journal, has been very busy in
telling how our Italians have taken all his surplus
honey, and had he not used <i>great</i> care, they
would have carried off all his honey, hives, bees
and all.</p>

<p>It was in this way. He came to us one day,
quite excited, saying that our Italians were robbing
his bees at a great rate&mdash;even some new
swarms in movable frame hives that we had let
him have, (not to mention several hours’ verbal
instruction and the attempt to answer all questions
pertaining to bee-culture at once).</p>

<p>“But that is impossible,” said we.</p>

<p>“Can’t you believe me when I tell you so?”
inquired he, angrily.</p>

<p>“We will go with you and see.”</p>

<p>On the way the conversation was resumed,
thus:</p>

<p>“You are sure you left no hives open, nor
anything sweet around?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“When did the robbing commence?”</p>

<p>“In the morning.”</p>

<p>“Have you taken off your surplus honey
yet?”</p>

<p>“Took it off this morning.”</p>

<p>“Where is it,” stopping in our walk.</p>

<p>“<i>In the orchard, on a table.</i>”</p>

<p>“Covered up?”</p>

<p>“No, I left it open to let the bees go out.
The boxes were full of them, and I could not
get them out.”</p>

<p>“Are they there now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Now, C&mdash;&mdash;, why in th&mdash;&mdash; did you
not do as we were very careful to tell you, and
put the honey in a large box with a white cloth
spread over it, to be turned over every hour or
two?”</p>

<p>“Well, it was too much trouble, and I did not
suppose it would make much difference.”</p>

<p>Of course we found boxes that had held about
forty pounds, empty, and oh, such music!
There <i>were</i> Italians there too, but we estimated
nine-tenths black bees to one-tenth yellow-banded
ones. Without giving the particulars,
we may say that we have since heard that our
bees had robbed him of sixty, and then eighty
pounds, and we don’t know what it will amount
to in the end.</p>

<p>The whole quantity of honey taken out by us
this season, is now six thousand one hundred
and sixty-two (6,162) pounds. Of this we sold
over two thousand (2,000) pounds, in June and
July, for thirty cents per pound, jars and all.
The jars do not cost us as much, in the end, as
boxes.</p>

<p>How does that figure, in comparison with box
honey?</p>

<p>Besides this, our forty-six (46) colonies have
been increased to sixty-four (64); and as the
upper frames are all full, and we have more bees
than the hives will hold, we propose to raise
queens this fall and make swarms of the upper
stories, perhaps eighteen (18) more.</p>

<p>How many of our co-workers in the melextractor
field have had trouble with heavy new
combs breaking down in hot weather? Well,
listen to our plan of putting them back. Throw
away your splints, wires, strings, &amp;c., and simply
lay all the pieces of comb, full of honey or
not, on a board the size of your frame; put the
frame over it in place, and then set the whole in
the upper part of some hive over night where
the bees have access. In the morning turn the
whole up in proper position, and slide your
board away, and as soon as the bees have repaired
that side too, it is ready for the melextractor.</p>

<p>Mr. Price says Novice’s feeder will not answer
for thin syrup. We are afraid he has not tried
one. Use new strong cloth, and there is no
trouble at all in feeding maple sap or even pure
water.</p>

<p>Why is it that we can never have any success
in trying to build up a stock by feeding? For
instance&mdash;We commenced putting the cappings,
after being drained, strainer utensils, &amp;c., in the
top of a hive to be “licked off.” As the hive
was handy, we kept them busy, and one other,
most of the time. Do you suppose it built them
up? Not at all! While other stocks were bringing
home from six to eight pounds a day, and
building comb rapidly, these two could not
“lick up” half that; and, further, would build
no comb at all until we stopped their “rations”
and saved our “trash” until the honey season
was over.</p>

<p>Colonies that are overstocked with honey in
August, should have some of it removed, either
by the honey extractor or by sliding off the caps
and laying the combs on a dish, to allow the
honey to drain out of the cells of the sides alternately.
When thus partially emptied, the comb
should be returned to the hive.

<h2>Bee-culture&mdash;East and West.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;I think the time has fully
come when your correspondent “<span class="smcap">Novice</span>”&mdash;that
notable personage of whom we have so often
read, and whose plans and acts have so often
fired our brain with new resolutions and determinations
to at least <i>try</i> to “go and do likewise”&mdash;should,
hereafter and evermore, drop that simple
title, and sign himself <span class="smcap">Adept</span>, <span class="smcap">Expert</span>, or
some other name a little more suggestive of the
manner in which he seems to “swing things”
of late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five thousand</span> (5,000) pounds of clover
honey, in about one month, from forty-six (46)
colonies of bees! That will do! Let’s all go
west. No use in trying to raise honey here any
longer!<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Why, Mr. Editor, in our locality this is simply
impossible. That amount of honey is not to be
had within the flight of our bees. Still, we seem
to have flowers enough. Is the country overstocked?
There are probably not more than
150 swarms, our own included, within a circle of
one mile from our place. All of our pastures
seem covered with white clover in its season;
and it lasted, in many places, this season, until
buckwheat came into bloom. The old raspberry
is said to be an excellent honey producing plant,
and its cultivation for bee pasturage is often recommended.
There are hundreds of acres of it,
within the flight of our bees, already covered
with this plant. Basswood grows wild here, to
some extent; and probably there are one hundred
trees near enough to be visited by our bees.
Buckwheat is also grown considerably&mdash;say fifty
acres, this season, within easy reach. Aside
from this, there are many scattering flowers in
bloom at different times, from which honey can
be extracted. And yet, of late, it is not one year
in five that surplus honey is obtained from any
other source than buckwheat.</p>

<p>I have this season increased our number of colonies
from thirteen to twenty-nine, wholly by
artificial swarming; but shall expect no surplus
of any consequence.</p>

<p>While walking through a pasture field one day
this season, where bees seemed to be working
freely upon white clover, I undertook the job of
watching a bee, in order to ascertain how many
clover heads were visited by her while collecting
one load of honey. Selecting a bee that looked
quite empty and had no pollen on her legs, I
commenced the count. How long she had
already been there, I, of course, did not know,
but I kept my eye upon her until she left the <i>five
hundred and eighty-second</i> clover head. Then
she flew over some weeds, and I lost sight of her.
Whether she then left for home, or not, I do not
know. The time occupied by her in making this
number of visits, was just one hour. Now, I do
not think that this shows a very bountiful yield
of honey, even though plenty of flowers exist.
This bee visited the same clover head several
times, while I was watching her.</p>

<p>If it was not for our fall pasturage of buckwheat,
as slim as it is, bee-keeping would, in this
section, be “played out,” as more honey is
usually obtained from this, than from <i>all other
sources combined</i>. It may be different in the
western and southern parts of the State; but, so
far as I am acquainted, I certainly think Pennsylvania
is not the best place in the world for
producing honey.</p>

<h2>Form of Hive, and Feeding Bees.</h2>

<p>I object to a low and flat shape of hive, for
reasons which I shall assign. I will first state,
however, that a hive of bees without provision
for the retention of animal heat, is as helpless as
a new born babe without raiment. Take, as an
example, a hive twelve inches square, containing
an oblong square perpendicular, and the
frames to suit in size and shape. Your combs
say eighteen inches in depth perpendicular, and
twelve inches wide. The bees, in order to hatch
brood, as the weather becomes warm in the
spring, will cluster at the larva end of said combs,
and keep up the temperature from bottom to top,
because of two combined reasons, the combs
being the long way perpendicular, and the natural
tendency of heat being to rise, it ascends
throughout the entire length of the combs, and
thus the proper temperature is attained throughout
the hive. It is a settled principle too, that
a given quantity or number of bees can produce
animal heat only sufficient in amount to rarify
the air in a given space to a given temperature.
Take, for example, a low flat hive, with combs
say eighteen inches long horizontal, and nine
inches deep, the hive being twelve inches wide,
the same as the other. Now remember the principle
just before stated. The bees will collect
at the front end of the comb, and the animal
heat, as generated, will ascend the same as along
the combs in the other hive, which are eighteen
inches deep; whereas these are only twelve inches
deep. Is it not obvious that here one-third of
every comb towards its rear end is entirely lost
to the bees, so far as the early production of
brood is concerned, because of the shape of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
combs and the natural tendency of the heat generated
to ascend? If the bees (being the same in
number in both hives,) were spread out at the
bottom of the combs in the last mentioned hive,
the full size of the hive, the cluster would be
twelve inches wide and eighteen inches horizontal.
Then, on the principle that a given
number of bees can generate only a certain degree
of heat in a given space, they would fail to
bring about the proper temperature in any part
of the hive; and the result would be that they
could not produce any brood. But allow them
(as they will) to contract the size of their cluster,
and you find that there is nearly one-third of
each comb not used by them in the production
of brood. Hence we find in the communications
of bee-keepers such remarks as these&mdash;“My bees
swarmed out of my common box and log gums
earlier than they did out of my patent hives.”
But universally we find in such cases that their
patent hives are low and flat in shape. We have
used such hives, and know by experience the
truth whereof we speak; and, fearless of successful
contradiction, we proclaim that the time
is not far distant when the practical bee-keepers
will adopt the shape of from a square to an oblong
perpendicular, the oblong being preferable.
We once were of those who thought there could
be no difference in the mere shape of a hive, but
justice to the true principles of bee-keeping compelled
a change of opinion.</p>

<p>There is still another reason why bees should
have a hive long up and down. In cases of long
continued extreme cold weather, the bees cannot
move in a lateral direction to obtain food. But
the warmth of the bees will aid them in obtaining
it from above, from the fact that their warmth
will ascend and keep the frost melted at a greater
distance from the bees above them, than on the
sides. And, further, when spring came, or in
the month of April, my bees almost always became
nearly extinct in the low flat form of hive.</p>

<p>Now, in conclusion, let me add some remarks
on <i>feeding</i>. There is a principle in the feeding
of bees that is truly astonishing in its effects.
They may be fed in sufficient quantity to cause
them to fill all the empty cells and thereby work
a complete destruction of the colony, if the owner
fails to remove some of the honey out of their
way. Or they may be fed in such proportions
that the prosperity and increase of the hive will
be somewhat like the rolling of a snow-ball&mdash;the
longer and further it rolls, the greater its magnitude
becomes. The queen has the ability to
deposit from 2,000 to 3,000 eggs every day in
the height of the breeding season; and if bees
are then excited by finding liberal supplies of
honey in the flowers, yet not in such abundance
as to cause them to fill the hive to overflowing,
brooding and rearing young bees will proceed
most rapidly. But if there is little honey or none
yielded by the flowers, and the bees remain idle
for some length of time, the queen will cease depositing
eggs; while on the other hand, if the
bees rapidly fill nearly all the cells with honey,
the queen must necessarily cease laying, for want
of room to deposit eggs.</p>

<p>Bees seem to have three periods of probation.
The first twenty-one days of their existence are
passed in the cell; the next eighteen or twenty
one days they spend in the hive mainly, nursing
brood exclusively, except when engaged at times
in building or repairing comb; the next period
is devoted to assiduous outdoor labor, and varies
from forty to fifty days, in the busy season of the
year.</p>

<p>Early and continued stimulation to activity,
by feeding the bees, causes the colony to become
strong in numbers. If therefore we wish for
handsome profits from the labors of the bees, we
must have them in great numbers, at all times
in the hive. If we expect great quantities of
honey from weak colonies, we are doomed to
disappointment. In almost every locality there
is a time, during the spring or summer, when
bees cannot gather nectar from the flowers.
Such spells are sometimes prolonged for months;
and in some years, in Iowa, in the month of
June, the writer has known colonies to starve to
death. In such times of scarcity, the bee-keeper
should always be on the alert, and begin feeding
only in sufficient quantity to produce activity in
the hive. It frequently occurs that bees use up
all the unsealed honey in the hive, and almost
stop brooding. They appear to be reluctant to
open their sealed honey. It seems that there is
a principle at this point which we have not been
able to grasp yet. I think that as a rule, if bees
run out of unsealed honey in the spring months,
the keeper should, from time to time, shave off
the capping of some of the full cells. This, I
think, would answer the same purpose as feeding,
by exciting the bees to activity. It should be
practiced in all cases where there is plenty of
sealed honey in the hive, in the forepart of the
season; and feeding only to a limited and small
extent, when the bees have used up their unsealed
supply. In fact, feeding should never be resorted
to, while the hive contains plenty of sealed
honey. Better uncap some of it.</p>

<p>It is not by any means desirable to have a hive
in the height of the breeding season, with the cells
so stored with honey that the queen is unable to
deposit eggs to the full extent of her powers.
Better extract some honey, even if you have to
return it again by feeding as the season advances,
thus keeping up the activity of the colony.</p>

<p>There are many attempts to systematize bee-keeping.
Some ideas communicated through the
Journal prove highly serviceable. Others drop
without effect, perhaps, except that they set bee-keepers
to thinking, and sometimes to experimenting,
which is useful, too, if it be not indulged
in at too great cost.</p>

<h2>Bee Letter from Middle Tennessee.</h2>

<p>Some weeks since, in company with a friend,
armed with a pint of strained honey and a bee-box,
we started for the edge of the cedars,
distant from my apiary, in a direct line, not less
than 2½ miles, where we found bees foraging.
We boxed and coursed many, but found none
that did not belong to my apiary. It was a very
warm day, and being wearied, without pushing
out a mile or two further, we returned home, to
renew our hunt in the fall.</p>

<p>All the trees I ever saw, having bees in them
(and I have seen many) had the entrance hole or
crack on the south or southeast side.</p>

<p>Native queens of colonies five miles distant
from Italian stocks, in two instances that I
know of, mated with Italian drones. And in
this connection, speaking of distances, I will
mention the reception through the mail of two
Italian queens, accompanied by about one
dozen workers each, from Wenham, Massachusetts.
Look on the map, and you will see it is a
long distance from here.</p>

<p>Very little surplus honey has been stored here
this season, on account of continuous rains
during the spring and summer. Late swarms,
not fed, have <i>gone up</i>. I have endeavored to
keep my bees breeding, giving them repeated
small quantities of honey, and have succeeded
in doing so; and buckwheat being now in bloom,
I hope to obtain a dividend for my outlay and
trouble, leaving enough for the worthy laborers
when nature shrouds herself in snow.</p>

<p>This is a great country to raise bees in, and I
would think more of them if they would swarm
less and store more honey. But swarm they
will, and they cannot be kept from it. Breaking
up an old hen from sitting when she has fairly
made up her mind to sit, is an easy job compared
to keeping bees from swarming in this section.
Swarming commences in Middle Tennessee
about the 20th of April, and becomes general
about the 5th of May. These new swarms often
cast a swarm in thirty days. Swarming is also
frequent in August if the season be a good one.
Our honey harvest is divided in two seasons&mdash;the
spring, embracing April and May; and the
fall, embracing August and September. Very
little honey is stored outside those two dates,
except perhaps in the month of March, if the
spring is forward and fruit trees come in bloom;
and in the month of October, if we have a
favorable fall and frost is delayed. There has
been no fall of honey dew this year.</p>

<p>Friend Novice’s allusion to air castles in his
communication in the Bee Journal for August,
<i>struck our flint</i>. We read his communication to
our better half. “Don’t believe a word of it!
Do you think that’s so?” Exclaimed she. “I
do. I have been following that Novice in print
some time, and always found him truthful.”
Here’s what’s the matter. A spruce old aunt
was at our house a few days since, and something
was said about new dresses and the fall styles,
when our better half broke loose with&mdash;“Don’t
expect to have anything new this year. Everything
we’ve made this year has been spent for
bee-gums and paints; and now the upstairs is
stored so full, there’s no place for old carpets and
lumber. There’s never been any money in that
here, yet, and I don’t believe there ever will be,”
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<h2>That Shallow Form of Hive.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;I see in the July number of
the Bee Journal, page 9, that Mr. C. Rogers is
out on “the shallow Langstroth Hive.” Mr. R.
and <i>my old friend</i> Gallup are the only persons
that I now recollect of, who complain of the
shallow form of hive, when wintered in a house
or cellar. Mr. Rogers says it is not a “good”
hive “for the six or eight weeks between the
winter and warm weather,” and leaves it thus,
without telling us why it is not. For my part,
I cannot see what the shape of the hive has to
do with the loss of bees in early spring. All bee-keepers
say that the bleak winds at that season
destroy a great many bees, regardless of the
kind of hive they may have been in. All the
proof Mr. Rogers gives that this form of hive is
bad in early spring is, that “he has sometimes
<i>thought</i> that his hives contained <i>less</i> bees after
being out a month or two, than when first put
out.” Well, suppose it is so, is that the fault
of the hive? Every experienced bee-keeper
knows that when bees in any form of hive are
taken from their winter quarters, there is a
sudden decrease in numbers, from the simple
fact that many of them are old and ready to die
at any hour from sheer old age; but having been
shut up all winter they live longer than they
would in the working season. Then, when taken
from their winter quarters and allowed to issue
in the open air, many of them never return.
But is this the fault of the hive? My experience
is that any form of hive, when wintered in a
cellar, will lose bees very rapidly when first set
out; much more so than a colony that has been
wintered on its summer stand. I can account
for this in no other way, than that many of the
bees have lived to a good old age, and are ready
to die soon; and a sudden change in the weather
being hard on them any how, weakens them
in numbers very fast.</p>

<p>The Langstroth hive could be made deeper very
easily without Mr. R.’s patchwork; but would it
answer the purpose as well? I have found no
other hive from which I can get the same results,
in surplus honey, as from the “shallow” Langstroth.
Last summer I tried the experiment
with a hive with only six inches depth of comb,
adding one more frame (<i>eleven</i> instead of <i>ten</i>.)
The result was that I got some six pounds more
honey from that hive, than I did from the
common Langstroth hive, sitting within four
feet of it and the two colonies as near alike in
numbers as I could get them. Without doubt
the shallow form of hive is best for surplus
honey.</p>

<p>Now a few words about wintering bees in the
Langstroth hive. Everything considered, I think
bees do somewhat better when wintered in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
cellar, provided they be arranged just right.
But I have wintered bees very successfully in
the Langstroth hive, on their summer stands, in
northern Illinois and eastern Indiana. But
young colonies that have new comb, should be
protected, if wintered on their summer stands.</p>

<p>I hope Mr. Rogers will explain the whys and
wherefores, and tell us wherein the Langstroth
hive is lacking.</p>

<h2>Letter from Missouri.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;I send you a sample of something
that seems to be troubling my bees very
much. It is in small scales resembling the wing
of some insect.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The bees come in with from
three to five sticking to their mouths. It seems
to trouble them greatly. I think I could pick up
or rather scrape up a pint of it, on the bottom
board of some hives.</p>

<p>This section of country is too much subject to
extremes for bees. Last year it rained all
through May and June, so that the bees could
not get out to work; and they did nothing but
swarm after that until September. Pollen was
plenty, but honey scarce. This spring commenced
well, but most of May and up to the 15th
of June the weather was too cold for bees to
work. Nearly all the fruit blossoms were killed
by cold. Wild plums and crab apples did not
bloom. We have had no rain for several weeks,
and very little since last fall. Everything is
parched up, leaving nothing for the bees. I am
feeding nearly fifty colonies, and will have to
continue doing so until we have rain and
flowers begin to bloom again.</p>

<p>I could exchange one little farm here for fifteen
hundred acres of mountain land in Pocahontas
county, Virginia. Is that a good bee section?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Too much wind here, even if the pasturage
were good. My Italians are doing much better
than the native bees.</p>

<p>I sowed the strap-leaved turnip last fall for early
pasturage, but none came up this spring. Cold
killed them. What kind is best to sow, or what
is better? Would it do to sow ten acres in
turnips, and mix Alsike clover seed with it?</p>

<p>I have watched nearly every movement a bee
can make for the last three years, and read all
the bee books I could get.</p>

<h2>How we made a Honey Knife.</h2>

<p>Some of our readers will perhaps remember
the trouble which we had last season in uncapping
cells preparatory to the use of the Honey Extractor.
In justice to Mr. Baldridge we will
say that the knife which we received from him
was found, upon trial, to work very well&mdash;much
better, in fact, than we expected. Our only
trouble with it, was to keep it in cutting order.
Still, we find that a knife for this business does
not need to be kept so extremely sharp, if it be
kept <i>hot</i> while in use, by occasionally dipping it
in hot water. In <i>shape</i> we think this knife about
what is wanted.</p>

<p>As <i>two</i> knives are found very convenient, one
to be heating in the water while the other is in
use, we concluded to try our hand at making
one and succeeded so admirably that we will
give a description of it, and the manner in which
it was made.</p>

<p>We first took an old <i>scythe</i>&mdash;an article which
can usually be found on every farm&mdash;and, with
a cold chisel, cut a piece out of the straightest
part, of such length as we wished the knife to
be. This was then laid upon a block and cut
lengthwise about three-fourths of an inch from
the cutting edge. It was now taken and ground
down smooth upon the back and ends, and the
edge ground off at the ends a little in order to
straighten it. It is then fitted into a suitable
handle. You thus have a knife of whatever
length you choose to make it, which may be
ground very thin and will yet hold an edge well.
The whole time occupied in making it, need not
exceed an hour, provided the assistance of a
second person can be had in cutting out and
grinding. It will present a much neater appearance
than one would think possible when commencing
the job, and will I think give perfect
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of course the style will be governed much by
the ingenuity of the maker.</p>

<p>Since writing, the above, we have received the
August number of the Bee Journal, and in it
notice the advertisement of the National Bee
Hive Company, of which Mr. Baldridge is
Secretary. It says&mdash;“no <i>wrought iron</i> knives for
sale, in fact never <i>kept</i> them, nor <i>sold</i> them. <i>Liars</i>
will please to take the hint.” Indeed! I sincerely
hope they will. Now, in justice to <i>myself</i>,
I must say a few more words in regard to that
knife, which we have already spoken about in
this communication. When we received the
knife last fall, it was shown to a person whom
we thought a competent judge of metal, and was
unhesitatingly pronounced&mdash;well, anything but
<i>spring-steel</i>, as it could readily be bent into
almost any shape, and would <i>so remain</i>. However
as its quality was not mentioned before the
purchase; and as it has been found, on trial, to
work well enough for all practical purposes,
when rightly used, I suppose we ought not to
have said anything about that part of the transaction.
The difference between the “best quality
of wrought iron” and the lower classes of
steel is so slight that, to separate them, would
be like naming the hour that sweet cider becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
sour. Iron is used in three states; as crude or
cast iron, as <i>steel</i>, and as wrought iron, the difference
only depending on the relative amount of
carbon with which the metal is combined&mdash;cast
iron containing a larger proportion of carbon than
steel, and steel more than wrought or malleable
iron.</p>

<p>I have nothing whatever against Mr. Baldridge,
this being my first dealing with him; and my
only excuse for writing as I did (A. B. J., vol V.,
page 18,) is that, after waiting, and watching
the post office, so long as I did, and finally receiving
a knife&mdash;too late for use&mdash;which did not
then come up to my expectations, I felt considerably
out of humor, and told the whole story, when
perhaps I should have kept <i>mum</i> and “swallowed”
it all, as he had not advertised knives for sale,
his reason for not being more prompt, may be
that he was obliged to invent and manufacture
it, after it was ordered. I have no doubt that
parties ordering of him now, will receive
knives that will give perfect satisfaction.</p>

<h2>More about the Looking-glass.</h2>

<p>On pages 34-5, Vol. VI., of the American Bee
Journal, H. Nesbit states that he has tried the
looking-glass theory to his satisfaction in <i>one</i> instance.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Editor, I wish to say, in reply, that
the glass has been tried three times, this year,
to my knowledge, and three swarms of bees secured.
The particulars of <i>one</i> case will be sufficient
to cause most of the Journal’s readers to
try the experiment, when opportunity offers,
whether one that has “<i>played</i>” the theory “<i>out</i>”
will try any more, or not.</p>

<p>An old lady was in her garden, about four
o’clock one afternoon, when her attention was
arrested by the hum of a swarm of bees, leaving
the top of an apple-tree that stood in the garden.
The superstitious notion of stopping bees by the
music of the cow-bell (peculiar to a certain class)
was soon put in practice, but the bees moved on
till <i>somebody</i> flashed the sun’s rays among them,
by the aid of a looking-glass. Then, almost instantly,
from some cause or another, the bees
scattered and some even fell to the ground; but
in a few minutes more, all were snugly clustered
on another apple-tree, in sight of the one on
which a portion of them were first discovered.</p>

<p>Did the queen stop to rest in this case? Perhaps
Mr. Nesbit will think she was defective;
or would his reply to this be as ambiguous as
his language, when he says in one place that
there is “no use of your trying to go away, for I
will stop you with the looking-glass;” and in
another breath, after he had tried and failed,
says&mdash;“I was rather a sceptic before.”</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, he makes me think of an old Dutch
lady, with whom I used to be acquainted, that
knew how to bake bread and fry meat. You
might read her a recipe from some agricultural
or other Journal, for making something new and
rich, and she would at once go about trying it,
“to see if it was good.” But, in place of following
the directions to the letter, she would use
the ingredients in quantities that seemed handiest;
and the consequence was that she would
make compounds to disagree with the gustatory
organs of all hands. The fault was never with
the old lady, and she could always tell that it
was in the recipe; but in no instance could she
be induced to try her hand a second time on the
same thing. Perhaps, if Mr. Nesbit will take
his looking-glass to the well and invert it, and
instead of looking down the well, will look into
the glass, he will see differently from the way he
did on the other occasion. If he will take a
glass large enough (a <i>piece</i> will answer the purpose;
but it will depend upon how bright the
sun shines, and the distance of the bees from the
ground, what must be the size of the glass required,)
I think he can stop a swarm in every
instance.</p>

<p>Before quitting, I will also say that if Mr.
Nesbit, or any one else will obtain the “<i>blackest</i>”
and “<i>knottiest</i>” piece of wood, near the size of a
quart pot, and secure it by means of a pole or
otherwise, surrounded by foliage, in front of the
apiary, before natural swarms issue, that by the
time the fifth natural swarm is hived, the experiment
will have very well paid him for his
trouble with the knot.</p>

<h2>Bee Humbugs.</h2>

<p>Since the introduction of movable comb hives,
numerous attempts have been made to palm off
on bee-keepers worthless hives and sundry humbugs.</p>

<p>As with other branches of business, so with
bee-culture; it has its proficients, amateurs,
novices, and pretenders. Generally, it is with
the two last-mentioned classes that worthless
hives and various humbugs originate. The novice
is often suddenly attacked with that disease
known as “bee on the brain,” and ignorantly
but innocently fancies he has mastered the whole
science of bee-culture, and is therefore prepared
to astonish the world by producing a bee hive
that will supplant all its predecessors. Now,
with many, to think is to act. Hence, yearly,
there are introduced to the public several “best
hives in the world,” which, however, prove to
be either bungling attempts at an imitation of
some good hive, or a worthless throwing together
of timber, embracing in its construction not one
scientific principle, but often many features directly
opposed to the nature and wants of the
bees. Their fanciful shape, novel construction,
and the many advantages they are said to possess,
often cause a number of them to be sold to
unsuspecting bee-keepers, who are not educated
in the science of bee-culture. The country is
full of such worthless trash, and parties often
pay more than they would require to do for really
good hives, the reputation of which has been
established for years&mdash;hives constructed by those
well acquainted with bee-culture, and who are
hence qualified to construct a hive adapted in
every feature to the wants of the bee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The other class, whom I have styled pretenders,
are generally unscrupulous persons, who do
not hesitate at anything by which they can bring
the “dimes” to their pockets. It is with this
class that “bee humbugs” generally originate.
Having a slight smattering of knowledge, they
make great pretensions, and tell wonderful
stories about bees&mdash;what strange things they
have known bees to do; how one swarm went
away, because the owner quarrelled with his wife;
another because a child was buried, and the
owner failed to whisper it in the hive; while a
third was so particular, that it would not stay
in the hive, because there was a rusty nail in
sight! In this way they arouse the curiosity
of the uneducated bee-keeper, who is soon
ready to swallow all they have to say. They
then come forward with their pretensions to
superior knowledge. They can do this or that
with bees. They have some wonderful secrets,
and for a “V” (five dollars) they can tell you
how to take the bees out of a box-hive, take
their honey, put them back again, and they shall
be all right “in the spring.” They have also
got a curious compound, a peculiar drug, with
which they can charm the bees so that they will
not sting, price “only fifty cents a bottle;” and
the recipe to make it only another “V.” Thus
the honest and unsuspecting bee-keeper is victimized,
while the swindling pretender “feathers
his nest.”</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter of inquiry,
has called forth these remarks:</p>

<p>“During the past season, the management of
bees has been taught in a secret school, and one
of the things taught is the art of drawing bees
from a tree a distance of two miles, even though
it may not be known where they are located.
As one of the students is preparing to sally out
on the public, I thought I would write to you,
for your opinion.”</p>

<p>A person possessed of such power as this would
be likely to surround himself with a large number
of swarms in a very short time, if he performed
his operations in some neighborhoods
where hundreds of swarms are kept within a
circle of two miles. He would certainly be an
exceedingly dangerous person to have about,
unless strictly honest, as he might draw off and
steal all the bees. Perhaps his secret incantations
have no attractions for bees that live in a
hive; and, I may say and, for bees that live in a
tree! Allow me to say to my bee-keeping friends
that all the bee drugs or bee charms are bee humbugs.
If any person is pretending to teach or to
do what is stated above, he is either a knave or
a fool, perhaps both.</p>

<p>To say the least, all such persons should be
arrested, for obtaining money under false pretences.
If bee-keepers would be safe, let them
take a reliable Bee Journal or agricultural paper,
where they will find such impositions exposed;
and in purchasing hives let them select such as
the experience of years has proved to be good.</p>

<h2>Proper Requisites of Hives and Movable Frames.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;There seems to be no subject
connected with bee-culture so badly mixed up,
as the above. One approves of a low and long
form of hive and frames, and another of a short
and deep form. Now I have seen and used nearly
all styles in use, but never saw a frame hive but
what was too deep for summer use, or too shallow
for winter.</p>

<p>It seems to me we have been straining at a
gnat and trying to swallow a camel. I think a
frame in the clear, six or seven inches deep and
eleven or twelve inches long is what the practical
bee-keeper needs. But for the careless and
indifferent, fixed top bars are too good.</p>

<p>Perhaps few if any have experimented with
and used more different styles of hive than we
have. Being a mechanic, and always having
lumber and tools at hand, we have experimented
too much for our own benefit. We have patented
(like many others) one hive costing us
$100; and have never realized a dime in return.
But all right; I suppose the greenbacks are
moving.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Editor, I believe that the one thousand
and one who are pocketing money for
improvements in hives, would be just as honest
and make more money, by picking up the farmer’s
box-hive, putting the Langstroth frames in,
and teaching people how to use them properly&mdash;selling
the same on commission for Mr. Langstroth
or his agents.</p>

<p>But we must return to the sectional hive. Has
any one ever used such a hive? If so we have
never heard of it. We use two sections deep in
winter, and from one to four in summer. We
make our case twelve inches wide, using eight
frames in the brood sections, and seven in the
third and fourth sections, in which we get the
greatest possible amount stored, in good shape
for the table or market. Mr. Thomas, or any
one else who thinks he has a hive that will offer
so many advantages, as the simple sectional box,
with Langstroth’s frames in them, had best
bring such hive out this way; and I will agree
to sell them as fast as forty men can turn them
out.</p>

<p>We have omitted to mention many little
points, in the arrangement of the case and
frames, such as beveling to prevent propolis, securing
straight combs, &amp;c., but will do so in a
future article, if requested.</p>

<p class="large caption">Washington, Sept., 1870.</p>

<p>The remarks on queen raising, by the Rev. Mr.
Briggs, in our last issue, appear to be considered by
some as aimed personally at Mr. Alley, of Wenham,
Mass. We did not so regard them. Mr. Briggs’
object seemed to us to be very different, and one in
which queen breeders in general have quite as much
interest as queen purchasers. Bee breeding, as a
science, is yet in its infancy&mdash;not less so in Europe
than here; but is evidently engaging the attention of
the best and most experienced apiarians, and has
already led to some highly interesting discussions in
the German Journals and Conventions. Of these
we shall, in due season, take proper notice&mdash;we give,
in this number of the Journal, several communications
referring to Mr. Briggs’ article, and shall probably
have one from him in explanation.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>👉 The March number of the American Bee
Journal contained a call for a meeting of the Michigan
Bee-keepers’ Association, to be held at Lansing,
on the 23d and 24th of that month.&mdash;Bee-keepers
from other States and the British Provinces were invited
to attend that meeting, as it was <i>proposed then
to make arrangements for holding a</i> <span class="smcap">National Bee-keepers’
Convention</span>. The Association met accordingly,
and it was resolved to hold a <i>National
Convention</i> at Indianapolis, (Ind.) on the 11th and
12th instant, but the time was subsequently changed
to the 21st and 22d of December next, as better suiting
the convenience of bee-keepers. The <i>place</i> designated
seems now, however, for some reason, to have
become objectionable to certain parties who probably
have “axes to grind.” They are now laboring hard
to effect a change; but we presume the effort will
fail, as we are assured from various quarters that the
Convention will be held at Indianapolis.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A patent has recently been granted for a method
of excluding bee-moths from hives by means of a
long lever operated by a hen-roost. The inventor
claims “a combination of a vibrating roost or perch
for fowls with the slides or doors of one or more bee
hives, when so constructed and arranged that the
weight of the fowls upon the roost shall close the
hives, and their removal from the roost shall open the
doors.” How this ingenious contrivance came to
be patented at this late day, we do not know; but
certainly it is neither, “new” nor “useful.” The
same thing was tried and abandoned many years ago,
as will be seen by reference to Langstroth’s “<i>Hive and
Honey Bee</i>,” page 263, first edition. Possibly there
is some new “modification” or some novel “combination”
of material (chickens included), on which
the claim to a patent is based; but unfortunately, no
modification or combination can ever enable him
who employs this contrivance to circumvent the
moths thereby.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When a colony in an apiary is found to be queenless,
and has been so till all the brood has matured,
it will generally be found difficult to get the bees to
raise a queen from brood inserted, or even to accept
and cherish a sealed queen cell. Repeated trials are
usually necessary, and when successful the population
has generally so dwindled, before the new generation
attains the working age, that the colony is of
little value, especially late in the season. The better
mode is to introduce at once a fertile prolific queen
from some populous colony, and let the latter do the
queen raising; unless we have fertile queens in reserve
in nuclei. With the transferred queen, several
combs of brood taken from other strong colonies,
should, if possible, be given to the one that has been
queenless. The desired object will thus be more
speedily attained, and frequently with benefit to the
colonies drawn on.</p>

<h3>The European Sparrow.</h3>

<p>“A large number of German sparrows, have been
imported and placed in the vineyards in the vicinity
of Davenport, Iowa.” So the newspapers inform us&mdash;the
object, we presume, being the destruction of
caterpillars. We fear, however, that the grape growers
there have made a capital mistake, and are likely
to have an easy time annually hereafter, when gathering
the vintage.</p>

<p>It has been customary to charge the bees with
damaging the grape crop, but it appears that in
Germany this sparrow is the real offender. The Rev.
Mr. Stern, an aged and well known bee-keeper, residing
at Wessenburg in Lower Austria, writing to
the Bienenzeitung about this alleged malfeasance of
the bees, says&mdash;“I have lived more than thirty years
in a village of three thousand inhabitants, most of
whom derive their support from grape culture.
Besides their vineyards, they have numerous trellises
of vines at their houses, and there are several apiaries
in the village. I have myself an arbor of vines,
180 feet in length, within twenty-five feet of my
apiary. Now it has happened for many years that I
did not get a single bunch of grapes, undamaged,
from any vine in this arbor, and the other grape-growers
in my neighborhood fared no better. Berries
torn open were annually to be seen, and I have seen
bees on <i>such</i> berries often&mdash;not indeed by ‘myriads’
nor yet by thousands, or hundreds, nor even by fifties,
but only here and there a solitary one quietly sipping
of the extruding juice. I have killed hundreds of
<i>hornets</i> in the act of tearing open the berries, and
thousands of wasps busy at the same work; but <i>I
have never seen a bee so engaged</i>. But, what flies and
bees are wholly incapable of doing, and what wasps and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
hornets do only in part and occasionally, <i>is really the
work of the</i> <span class="smcap">Sparrow</span>, which, because its habits have
been little observed or studied, continues to be held in
high estimation in some districts. Even a small number
of these birds can, in a few days, do exceedingly
great injury in a vineyard, at the time when the ripening
grapes are becoming mellow. They then peck
open berry after berry, as though in sport, sip a little
of the juice occasionally, and flitting away to some
other cluster incessantly repeat the damaging process.
I have witnessed this hundreds of times; and seen
them do the work so effectually that, year after year,
I have not obtained one undamaged cluster from my
arbor.&mdash;This cunning sparrow knows, too, how to
avoid traps and springes, and soon familiarizes himself
with the most elaborate fantastic scarecrow set
up <i>in terrorem</i>, acting apparently in derision and
contempt of the baffled and mortified grape-grower.”</p>

<p>Forty years ago, an American ornithologist, speaking
of this species of sparrow and the injury done by
it to grain fields in Europe, said&mdash;“<i>Fortunately we are
free from this pest on this side of the Atlantic.</i>” Now
we import them, and boast of it!</p>

<h2>CORRESPONDENCE OF THE BEE JOURNAL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyrone, Ontario</span>, July 16.&mdash;Bees are doing very
well here this year. I have got forty pounds surplus
honey from some of my hives already.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. McLaughlin.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington Harbor, Wis.</span>, July 16.&mdash;This has
been the best honey season, thus far, seen by me. A
second swarm hived on Tuesday June 21st, on Wednesday
night the 29th, weighed twenty-five pounds,
besides having yielded thirty-eight pounds ten ounces
taken by honey machine in eight days. I had given
the swarm seven old combs and one empty frame,
placed it on the old stand, and removed the old stock
to a new place. On the 25th and 26th, it gained
twenty-one pounds six ounces in two days, on raspberry
and clover blossoms. This is the best day’s
work and week’s work I have noticed. The queen
began to lay on Monday the 27th, so they had no
brood to nurse.</p>

<p>The next fourteen days they lost four pounds each.
Basswood began to bloom July 13th. One hive
gained fifteen pounds in four days; and in the next
ten days I expect my five hives to gain thirty to forty
pounds each, which closes the honey season here.
The last two years the hives lost more in weight from
the 1st of August to the 1st of November, than in five
months in the cellar to 1st of April.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. D. Miner.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borodino, N. Y.</span>, July 16.&mdash;I think that you publish
by far the best Bee Journal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gansevoort, N. Y.</span>, July 20.&mdash;I think the American
Bee Journal worthy of every bee-keeper’s attention,
whether he keeps one stand or a hundred.</p>

<p>I would like to learn from some more experienced
bee-keepers than myself, the best way to set bees for
summer; whether exposed to the sun, in the shade
of trees, or under a shelter made of boards.</p>

<p>It has been very dry here all summer, and flowers
have nearly all dried up. Bees have swarmed but
little and have not stored much cap honey. Box
hives are mostly used here, though there are some
others of different kinds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Pierce.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rich Valley, Minn.</span>, July 20.&mdash;The season for bees
has been fair thus far; but I do not think this location
so well adapted to the business as most of the
States south.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L. M. Lindley.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ridgeway, Mich.</span>, July 21.&mdash;I have one hundred
and thirty colonies in box hives, somewhat like T. B.
Miner’s equilateral hive. I shall have about twenty
hundred pounds of honey for sale this season.</p>

<p>I cannot learn that it would be wise for me to
adopt the movable comb hive, as I have five hundred
dollars invested in box hives, and have been successful
with them. So far as I can learn I have the
largest apiary in Michigan, and have perhaps, in the
last thirteen years sold more surplus honey than any
apiarian using box hives, or perhaps any other
kind of hive. Honey sells for twenty to twenty-five
cents per pound.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. F. Temple.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Augusta, Me.</span>, July 22.&mdash;This is a very dry season
with us. Bees will not give much surplus honey;
and in some cases old stocks will not get honey
enough to winter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. B. Coney.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gebhartsburg, Pa.</span>, July 22.&mdash;This has been a
remarkable honey season, and also for swarming. I
practice artificial swarming, yet in spite of all precautions
I got two natural swarms, and that too
without the least preparation by the bees, for no
queen cells had been started. This is contrary to the
books and my previous experience.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Baker.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hamilton, Ill.</span>, July 24.&mdash;No Bee Journal either
on the old continent or the new, can vie with the
American Bee Journal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Dadant.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Niagara, Ontario</span>, July 30.&mdash;We have had a good
honey season, through June and part of July, from
white clover; but I do not think bees are doing much
now. I lost some honey for want of shade. The
combs melted, though in double boxes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. G. Nash.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excelsior, Minn.</span>, July 30.&mdash;Bees have done very
well here, until the middle of this month, the season
having been an unusually fine one, up to that time.
Since then, we have had a change of weather and
bees are doing nothing. The season has been a very
dry and hot one, thus indicating&mdash;not for the first
time&mdash;that dry warm seasons are the best for honey
in this latitude.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. W. Murray.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">East Fairfield, Ohio.</span>&mdash;Bees are doing very nicely
here this year. I should like to see your valuable
Journal have a wide circulation, and if it were carefully
read, I think bee-keepers would generally do
well.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Heustis.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Springfield, Ill.</span>, August 4.&mdash;Our pets have done
nothing since 20th of June, but eat up what they
saved before. The “heated term” has been unusually
severe and long. We look for better things, now
that the weather has changed and vegetation begins
to revive. This morning one of my early June
swarms (Italian) threw off a very large swarm. On
examining the hive, I was not a little interested and
surprised to find five beautiful young queens, evidently
stretching their legs (my queens have legs) for the
first time. Three went “where the woodbine
twineth.” I had use for the other two. Is not the
simultaneous hatching of so great a number unusual?&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. L. Gross.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">North Tunbridge, Vt.</span>, August 7.&mdash;We have had
a very great season here for honey, but not as much
swarming as usual. My bees have given me a profit
of twenty-four dollars per swarm, in box honey.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D.
C. Hunt.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleveland, Ohio</span>, August 8.&mdash;I think we have a
very poor locality for bees&mdash;the land being too flat,
wet, and cold. No honey in the white clover blossoms
this year.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Honey.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virden, Ills.</span>, August 8.&mdash;We never had so good a
season of white clover, in my recollection, as the past
has been; but it has been so dry since that the bees
have done nothing since the 1st of July. Our fall
pasturage too will be short, on account of the drouth.
Last year I got all my surplus honey after this time,
mostly from Spanish needles and red clover. There
will be very little of either this fall, consequently I
do not expect much more surplus honey. I have
increased my bees from twenty-five colonies to sixty-five.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
L. Peabody.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paw Paw, Mich.</span>, August 8.&mdash;The ever welcome
American Bee Journal was received as usual. It
contains a variety of reading matter from all sources,
and it sounds like glad tidings unto all people. I
have only one fault to find&mdash;it should come on the
first and fifteenth of each month. How can that
desirable end be accomplished? Will not our brother
bee-keepers co-operate to bring it about? Bees have
done finely here, this season.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. F. Moon.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ripon, Wis.</span>, August 8.&mdash;The Journal comes to
hand promptly every mouth, accept my thanks for
the effort you make to furnish us with a first class
paper.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Dart.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Towanda, Ills.</span>, August 9.&mdash;The season for honey
in this section of the country has not been the best or
the poorest. Bees on the prairies did not swarm
much, and there was great complaint of their leaving
for the timber. One man here found fourteen (14)
bee trees in one grove. But in the timbered portion
of the country, the bees swarmed wide and gathered
the usual amount of honey, namely fifteen to twenty-five
pounds per stand.</p>

<p>Increased attention is being given to the culture of
bees here, and I hope I shall be able to send you a
much larger list of subscribers for your <i>excellent</i>
Journal.</p>

<p>An accident occurred in the apiary of Mr. Cyrus
Jones, in this township, that would probably come
under the head of “Anger of Bees.” While his hired
man with the team, was hauling some old lumber
from the yard, the horses became frightened and ran
directly among the bees, knocking over seven stands
and becoming fastened for a short time in a cherry
tree. The bees swarmed out not only from those
stands that were run over; but from most of the
others (there being some twenty stands in all) stinging
the horses terribly. The horses became frantic,
rearing and plunging, broke loose from the tree, and
ran into the next lot, breaking the wagon badly. One
of them died in about three hours, and the other in
the course of the day. While they were fastened in the
tree, one of the men in throwing water on the horses,
to <i>cool</i> I suppose the anger of the bees, lost his hat.
The bees lighting on him stung his head and face so
badly that his life was in danger. The horses were
stung in their ears, nostrils, and bodies so badly that
by taking a corn knife and scraping their sides, you
could draw out thousands of stings. Mr. Jones estimates
his loss at about five hundred (500) dollars.
This accident occurred last spring. What would
have been the best to do, in such a case?&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. C. Ware.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wenham, Mass.</span>, August 11.&mdash;The weather has
been very dry and hot all summer; but during the
last few days we have had plenty of rain, though the
air is not cooler.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Alley.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lexington, Ky.</span>, August 12.&mdash;The July number of
the Journal failed to come. I began to fear you had
ceased to publish the Journal, as I did not receive
one for so long. <i>That</i> I hope will never happen, as
long as it is doing the good to the bee-keeping public,
that it now is. Long life to you and it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J.
Dillard.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lisle, N. Y.</span>, August 12.&mdash;As your correspondents
commenced boasting early, I should like to hear
from them again, to learn whether the drouth affected
them as much as it has us, in this part of the country.
I think bees never did better than they did during
raspberry time. It then became so dry that they
have not got much since, till now that they are working
on buckwheat freely. From one double Langstroth
hive we have taken seventeen full six pound
boxes, and the bees are working in six more. They
filled both hives themselves, except six frames that
were transferred. I think this is doing very well, as
it will make eighty pounds in frames more than they
need to winter on. We are sure of thirty-six pounds
more. We have a good many young swarms that
have already over one hundred pounds of box honey
taken off. I will give you, this fall, the total result.
I think it will convince people that bee-keeping pays.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.
S. Wells.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Campbell’s Cross, Ontario</span>, August 12.&mdash;I have
the first four volumes of American Bee Journal bound
in two, and would not take five times their cost if I
could not get them again. I would freely pay double
to get them twice a month. It would pay to get
them, if a person has only one hive, or no bees at all.</p>

<p>Bees have done well, in this section, this season.
They swarmed two weeks earlier than usual. We
have plenty of swarms and surplus honey. Second
and even some third swarms will gather honey
enough to winter on. My bees are all in frame hives.
The Thomas hive is all the go in Ontario. My bees
are nearly all Italians, bred from the stocks of J. H.
Thomas, Brooklin, Ontario, and Henry Alley, Wenham,
Mass.,&mdash;both of whom I could recommend,
their stock of Italians being very pure and well
marked.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Lipsett.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gnadenhutten, Ohio</span>, August 15.&mdash;We have had
a prosperous season, this summer, both for honey and
swarms. The weather was good from the time the
fruit trees blossomed until the close of the white
clover blossoms. It is refreshing to the drooping
spirit to have a season of plenty after such poor seasons
as the previous two were. Our success would be
better if we had some reliable plants to supply honey,
after the white clover is past. That is now our main
dependance, and when it is a partial failure our late
swarms cannot gather sufficient store to last them
over winter; and buckwheat is at best an uncertain
source for honey.</p>

<p>As there is considerable rivalry among inventors
about patent hives, and divers contrivances are
recommended to bee-keepers as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
perfection, I will state that some years ago I invented
a side-opening leaf hive, with a sliding bottom board.
Either front or rear side is a door, through which the
bottom board slides. At the opposite end of the hive
from the door, in the side of the hive, is a frame or
yoke, fastened to the sides of the bottom-board and
reaching half way up the side of the hive. On top of
said yoke are clasps fastened loosely to the yoke with
wire rivets. These clasps hold the frames by means
of wire hooks driven into the frames and hooking
over a shoulder on top of the clasps. The clasps
move sideways, and allow the frames to be moved
sideways, like the leaves of a book, and also to be
taken off. The part of the hive with a hook in, has
a piece of wire driven in at the bottom, to serve as a
pivot, and works in a gimlet hole in the bottom
board. In operating with the bees in, the door is
opened and the fastenings made by the bees are to be
cut loose; then the bottom board with the frames is
drawn out of the hive. It is perhaps as good a side-opening
hive as any, with the additional good quality
that there is no patent on it. Any one is at liberty
to use the invention. For myself, I prefer top opening
hives, as more convenient.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Luethi.</span>

[For the American Bee Journal.]</p>

<h2>Death of James T. Langstroth.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor:</span>&mdash;I desire to offer, through the
medium of the American Bee Journal, a slight
tribute of respect to the memory of <span class="smcap">James T.
Langstroth</span>, the only son of Rev. L. L. Langstroth,
whose death was announced in the July
number of the Journal.</p>

<p>Mr. James T. Langstroth was well known to
most of the leading bee-keepers of the country,
either personally, or through business correspondence
relating to bee-culture, during the last ten
years; and certainly no young man could have
more completely won the confidence of all with
whom he came in contact, than he has done, by
his intelligence, modesty, strict integrity, promptness,
candor, and perfect manliness in all his
transactions. Aside from bee-culture, he took
an active interest in, and was generally at the
head of, all patriotic, charitable, or social organizations
in his immediate neighborhood.
In fact, he was the leading young man in the
town in which he lived. But above all his other
excellent qualities, stands, in my estimation, his
unselfish and untiring devotion to his aged,
infirm, and dependent parents. Next to the
care of his own little family, his father’s,
mother’s, and sister’s comfort, wants, and
wishes, were uppermost in his mind. Although
suffering many months from the insidious approach
of consumption, yet fraternal and filial
devotion nerved his wearied spirits to active
labor, almost to the last day of his life. I saw
him on his return home from his office for the
last time, with glazed eye and haggard cheek,
yet full of hope and plans for the future, after
a few days of rest and recreation.&mdash;But his
earthly career is ended, and that father’s only
support is taken away. Who will take that son’s
place? Who <i>should</i> take his place, unless it be
the bee-keepers of America? Brother bee-keepers,
laying aside all prejudice, and all minor
points of difference, and detracting nothing from
any man’s merits, are we not indebted to the
Rev. Mr. Langstroth, more than to any other
person for a part of our success in our noble
pursuit or pastime?</p>

<p>There is one point, I believe on which the bee-keepers
of the country, and even all patentees
of bee hives, of <i>whatever kind</i>, agree&mdash;namely,
that Mr. Langstroth <i>introduced</i> movable frame
hives into this country. Admitting for a moment,
that that was all he ever did for the benefit of
bee-keepers, does not even that act deserve some
compensation from our hands? I think it does.
Again, Mr. Langstroth was among the very first,
and but for an accident would have been the
first to introduce into this country the Italian
bee. He has imported them every year since,
and has every year furnished the leading queen
breeders of this country with their choicest
queens to breed from. Do we owe him nothing
for this? Again, he was the first to introduce
into this country the Egyptian bee, the merits of
which are not yet fully developed, but the importance
of which will in time come to be duly
appreciated. And, lastly Mr. Langstroth, was
among the first to introduce to the notice of the
bee-keepers of America, the invaluable Honey
Extractor. Does he deserve nothing at our
hands for this? Gentlemen, talk as you will,
Mr. Langstroth has been the pioneer bee-keeper
of this country for the last quarter of a century;
and there is a fearful account against us, and in
his favor, that I fear we shall not be able fully
to pay. But we can do something. We can
make him comfortable for the balance of his
days, and still be vastly enriched ourselves
through his labors.</p>

<p>If we are so indebted can we not, in part,
liquidate that indebtedness <i>now</i>? Can we not
make up our minds to send him, <i>at once</i>, some
substantial token of our appreciation of his
labors of a lifetime for the advancement of bee-culture?
He and his family, and his son’s family
now dependent on him, need all that is rightfully
due to them. If you feel that you owe him five,
ten, twenty, or a hundred dollars, don’t wait for
somebody else to begin or to join with you; but
send a check or a post-office order for the amount
directly to his address. If you have honestly
paid him his price for the right to use his invention,
don’t let that entirely satisfy you. Ask
yourself whether you have not made too good a
bargain, and whether you ought not to restore
to him, to-day, a part of your profits? Don’t
stop to inquire whether Mr. Langstroth owns
territory where you live, send him a five dollar
or a ten dollar bill at once, and pay the rightful
or legal owner of the territory, as soon as you
find him out. You could better afford to pay
five dollars royalty on every movable frame
hive you use, than use the old box hive. This
deferred payment, let us call it, made <i>now</i> will do
much good, and will give you a clear conscience,
no matter whose patent you are using, for they
are all modifications of the Langstroth hive,
although they are not all infringements. Brother
bee-keepers, don’t wait for each other to respond,
but send at once to this address&mdash;Rev. L. L.
Langstroth, Oxford, Butler County, Ohio; and
may heaven prosper you for so doing.</p>

<p>The Egyptian beehives are made of coal dust
and clay, which being well blended together, the
mixture is formed into a hollow cylinder about a
span in diameter and from four to six feet high.
This is dried in the sun, and becomes so hard
that it may be handled at pleasure.&mdash;<i>Domestic
Encyclopædia.</i></p>

<p>Whoever intends to erect an apiary should
purchase colonies towards the close of the year,
and only such as are full of combs and stocked
with a sufficient number of bees should be chosen.
To ascertain the age of the hives, it should be
remarked that the combs of the last season are
white, while those of former years are dark
yellow. Where the combs are black, the hive
should be rejected, as too old and liable to the
attack of vermin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Willich.</span></p>

What was the average annual yield of honey, per hive, in
Novice’s locality, when he began to keep bees? What were his
surroundings <i>then</i>, as regards bee pasturage? and what are
they now? If improved, are they so proportionately to the
increased quantity of honey obtained? Would anybody <i>then</i>
have believed it possible, by any means that could be devised,
to secure, in any apiary, 6,162 pounds of surplus in
four weeks, or five times four, from the area of bee pasturage
within the range of the bees’ flight, taking the town of his
residence as the centre?
</p>
<p>
Now, if we mistake not greatly, the locality in Pennsylvania,
as described by Mr. T., furnishes quite as ample pasturage,
<i>naturally</i>, as that visited by Novice’s bees. Probably
an unprepossessed observer, noting appearances or indications
in each, would give the Pennsylvania locality the preference;
and, very likely, Novice himself, at the outset, had he been
called on to choose, and been free to select, would have so decided.
Whence then the difference in the present results?
Let Novice come east, and we shall see. We do not propose
that he shall emigrate hither <i>in propria personæ</i>; no, but
that his beekeeping <i>spirit</i> shall be imported. Let his mode of
management be investigated, adopted, applied, and carried
out in its spirit and to the letter. Then, if the result be not
equally good, it will be early enough to attribute the shortcoming
to some natural or climatic inferiority.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

The substance enclosed to us was so crushed and pulverized
in the mail that we could not make out what it was, even
with the aid of a microscope. At first view it seemed as if
minute scales of wax were mingled with it, but none of it melted
when exposed to heat. We presume it is of vegetable origin.</p></div>

We do not know how bees thrive in the part of Virginia
referred to by our correspondent. Probably some of our subscribers
in that section could supply the desired information.
A large part of Virginia is unquestionably a first-rate bee
country, and hardly second-rate in anything else.
</p>
<p>
What sort of crop to cultivate for early bee pasturage,
in a climate as variable and uncertain as that which
the writer describes, could only be ascertained by trial and
experience. Alsike clover is only suited to a somewhat damp
soil, otherwise in good condition. How far south or south-west
it can be cultivated with advantage, for bees and cattle,
is not yet known. We have no seed for sale&mdash;not dealing in
seeds, bees, queens, or hives; but contenting ourselves with
publishing the American Bee Journal, and striving to make
that unsurpassed and unsurpassable.</p></div></div>
